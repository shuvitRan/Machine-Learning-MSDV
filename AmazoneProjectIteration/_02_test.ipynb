      "So, a few years back, when my son was just 18 months old, I discovered these and thought they'd be great with chili (they were!). As I was eating them, my son saw them and wanted to try them. I figured, what the heck, they were kinda spicy but not enough to hurt the little guy. So I gave him a couple. He loved them! So, I gave him a handful, and he munched away happily.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the next day.<br /><br />My wife is in the office when she hears a blood-curdling scream from my son's room!<br /><br />She rushes in to see what's the matter, and there stands my son, a look of panic on his face, yelling \"Mom-Mom help! Hot poop! Hot poop!\" as he reaches back into his diaper to try and get it all out.<br /><br />Needless to say, at the time my wife was not amused.<br /><br />However, this brand of cracker has henceforth and forevermore become known in our family as \"Hot Poop Cheez-Its.\"<br /><br />And yes, my son still loves them.\n",

      "Out of all the coffee companies out there, I've probably been the most loyal to Millstone Coffee Company. Since 2001, I've been drinking Millstone Coffee Company coffees. In my opinion, they're honestly one of the nicest companies out there. In 2001, one of the few and rare times I entered an online contest/sweepstakes, I won second prize in Millstone's \"Gourmet Getaway Weekend\" sweepstakes. They gave me a Capresso Coffee Grinder and a package of their Foglifter coffee. I still have that Capresso Coffee Grinder in my kitchen. Honestly, Millstone's coffees do stand out. They're smooth, rich-tasting, and bold. And you truly get what you pay for with these coffee products. My co-workers and I have tried the majority of their products over the years ranging from Chocolate Velvet, Foglifter, French Vanilla, French Roast, Kona Blend, Caramel Truffle, Hazelnut Cream, Pumpkin Spice, etc. Millstone Coffee Company stay very true to the flavors they advertise on their coffee products. When you buy their Caramel Truffle - you taste the caramel. When you buy their Hazelnut Cream - you taste the hazelnut. When you buy their Pumpkin Spice - you taste the pumpkin. And of course, when you buy their Chocolate Velvet - you taste the chocolate. My co-workers and I have tried many coffees from many coffee brands over the years. And out of all the coffees out there that advertise \"chocolate\" flavor - Millstone, according to my opinion and my co-workers' opinions, are truly the most honest in advertising their \"chocolate\" flavor. You really do taste the chocolate in their Chocolate Velvet coffee. For example, I bought a bag of Godiva Chocolatier's Chocolate Truffle coffee a few months ago, and my co-workers and I were honestly very disappointed each time we made Godiva Chocolatier's Chocolate Truffle coffee. It didn't matter how strong we made the coffee - we didn't taste chocolate at all. My family, co-workers, and I think that Godiva Chocolatier make excellent and innovative chocolate candies and baked goods. I also think that Godiva Chocolatier's Lady Godiva 2011 mug they're currently selling online by New York artists Kurt Huggins and Zelda Devon is a beautiful and unique mug that many coffee drinkers would like to add to their coffee mug/tea cup collection. In my honest opinion, that Lady Godiva 2011 mug screams \"Lady Gaga\", and if I met Lady Gaga I would definitely give her that Lady Godiva 2011 mug as a gift because that mug just reminds me of her and I know that Lady Gaga loves all things New York-related, and New York-based designers created that mug. Really, I think that the Godiva Chocolatier company should send Lady Gaga that mug along with some of their hot chocolate. Anyways, if you want my complete honesty, if there is any Godiva Chocolatier product that needs improvement, it's their coffee. Really, out of all the companies out there, my co-workers and I thought that Godiva Chocolatier would make the best chocolate-flavored coffee, but it ends up that Millstone Coffee Company make the best chocolate-flavored coffee. Who knew? My verdict: Millstone Coffee Company make the best chocolate-flavored coffee - Chocolate Velvet. In general, they are truly one of the best coffee companies out there. And I hope that the Millstone Coffee Company make more flavored coffees in the future. To Millstone Coffee Company, if you're reading this - My co-workers and I have drank your coffees for more than a decade now. We have tried almost every coffee you have produced and made. We want more! Please make some new flavored coffees - we would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!\n",

In the 50s and 60s, my siblings and I bought Banana Splits - two for one penny in the Midwest. This delicious candy brings back fond childhood memories. I highly recommend these wonderfully flavored, chewy delights.

      "My dog (a 30 pound wire hair fox terrier and corgi mix) absolutely LOVES this toy!!! I originally got it so that he could have something to do while I was gone and he was in his crate, and was very disappointed to find that he pulled the circular rawhides off in a matter of minutes...at first I thought, \"well there goes 10 bucks down the drain!\". But after that, it became his FAVORITE bone. He just loves throwing it around and chewing on the bone ends. It lasted about 6 months before he chewed both ends off (note: he is a very very intense chewer), and even after that, he still loves playing with the purple ball that came in the middle. I bought him a new bone for christmas and again, he can't get enough of it. My roommates dog has the same feelings for these bones, and we have affectionately started calling them their \"crack\" bones because we don't know why they are completely obsessed with them! I would highly highly recommend!!!\n",

      "I got this drink after my brother had one and said it was amazing. I believe his words were \"viagra in a cup\" lol. He said that it made his sex life amazing. I was curious to try one, but no stores will carry something with the word \"gasm\" in the tile. The day it arrived it just so happened I hadn't eaten at all since early that morning and it was about dinner time. I had one, which tasted great, a nice little buzz in the brain came on after a couple sips. I didn't notice anything after that so I immediately had another one. I didn't realize it takes a few minutes for these to take affect. I was seriously sceptical about these but a few minutes after after my second something happend. BAM, this stuff had a major affect on me. I have a high libito to begin with, but after taking two of these, OH MY GOSH! I've never had sex before or anything like it because I'm waiting to with my wife, so believe me when I tell you this stuff does not help when living an abstinence lifestyle lol. I had to go workout for 2.5 hours to work off the amount of \"energy\" this stuff gave me. This is not a placebo affect I assure you haha. For this to work best you have to take it on an empty stomach and it really does work. Hope this helped!\n",

      "I have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years.  It was the only canned chicken sold in North America that contained no food additives.  It was just chicken, water, and sea salt.<br /><br />As of this month( March 2011) new labelling and contents  have appeared.  The label now proclaims \"Better Flavor\".<br /><br />The product now contains 50% more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing \"reduced sodium\" vesions of their tradtional products.<br /><br />Worse yet, the \"Better Flavor\" is achieved by adding \"rice starch\", \"vegetable starch\" ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch) and \"chicken broth\" - which contains, among other listed ingredients, \"natural flavor\" (derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ).<br /><br />This product is now useless to me as I am highly sensitive to corn products.  While the label still claims the product is gluten free, which was pretty much guaranteed before, since it had only chicken water and sea salt in it, this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive, there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and \"flavors\"<br /><br />The company needs to re-think this change.  What made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets, was their plain and simple good food.  Now they are little differnt from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives.<br /><br />They can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn, processed starches, who are on the Atkins or no grain diets, who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes, and who avoid processed food additives in general.<br /><br />The company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say \"potato starch\" rather than \"vegetable starch\" AND in bold print say \"Contains Corn\" to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product.<br /><br />Hopefully this \"Better Flavor\" change will be about as successful as New Coke\" and we will see Valley Fresh \"Classic\" chicken in a year so.\n",

      "My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition. After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat. The old cat would eat anything. The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food. He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat. That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list. The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives. The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it. When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione. I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health. The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses. Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion. (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite. I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion. Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients. No by-products here! It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it. He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it. I've tried every single flavor of the \"in gravy\" flavors (I haven't tried the \"in gelee\" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this. There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it. There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition. I'm sold!\n",

      "Ingredient list on the package (which as we know goes from most to least): California raisins, yogurt coating (sugar,partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil, nonfat milk powder, nonfat yogurt powder, whey, titanium dioxide, soy lecithin, vanilla), confectioners glaze, corn syrup, dextrin and maltodextrin.<br /><br />This \"yogurt coating\" is basically sugar and partially hydrogenated oil, in other words TRANS FAT, which has undeniable harmful effects on your health. Palm oil is saturated fat, anyways. All the yogurt it conatins is a tiny bit of yogurt POWDER. And it has titanium dioxide, which is also an effective sun block that you wingredient<br /><br />Look at all that sugar named in different ways: sugar, confectioners glaze and corn syrup. As for the titanium dioxide, from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Pigment<br />\"...When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like \"mystic fire topaz\". TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as \"the perfect white\", \"the whitest white\", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.<br />In ceramic glazes titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation.<br />Titanium dioxide is often used to whiten skimmed milk; this has been shown statistically to increase skimmed milk's palatability.[23]<br />Titanium dioxide is used to mark the white lines on the tennis courts of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, best known as the venue for the annual grand slam tennis tournament The Championships, Wimbledon.[24]<br />The exterior of the Saturn V rocket was painted with titanium dioxide; this later allowed astronomers to determine that J002E3 was the S-IVB stage from Apollo 12 and not an asteroid.<br /><br />Sunscreen and UV absorber<br /><br />In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. It is also used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils. Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes, oil and water dispersible, and with varying coatings for the cosmetic industry. This pigment is used extensively in plastics and other applications for its UV resistant properties where it acts as a UV absorber, efficiently transforming destructive UV light energy into heat.<br />Titanium dioxide is found in almost every sunscreen with a physical blocker because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals. The titanium dioxide particles used in sunscreens have to be coated with silica or alumina, because titanium dioxide creates radicals in the photocatalytic reaction. These radicals are carcinogenic, and could damage the skin.\n",

      "When you compare the zesty Limonata Sparkling Lemon Beverage to other sparkly lemon beverages, you begin to realize the sheer perfection of the Limonata beverage by San Pellegrino. The balance of lemon, sparkle and zest takes this drink to the level of a gourmet beverage, which requires no mixing. I may have tasted this before, but recently ordered it while eating out at a Restaurant.<br /><br />San Pellegrino is also made with mineral water found near the town of San Pellegrino Terme which is located 70 kilometers northeast of Milan. The water flows from a thermal spring at the foot of a Dolomite mountain wall. The use of this water definitely adds to the energy this drink seems to possess.<br /><br />The carbonation seems more sophisticated and delicate. The only way to describe it is to say these waters are the champagne of sparkling waters.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "I got one bag as a sample for review and tried giving one of the treats to my dog, but she wasn't willing to give it a serious try. I let her keep it for a week and every once in a while she'd toss it around the living room or pick it up and carry it around for a minute, but she never made any real effort to eat it.<br /><br />I ended up giving 2 of them to my nephew's dog, and he seemed to like them all right. I took the remainder to a playdate my dog was having with 3 other dogs and out of those one chewed on one a little but didn't seem awfully interested, one took no interest at all, and one really liked them. I tossed the bag after the playdate, forgetting that I'd want it for reference, but I seem to remember not being very thrilled by the ingredient list either.<br /><br />The final tally for me was 2 dogs out of 5 who seemed to like it, 1 who thought it was okay but nothing special, and 2 who didn't have any real interest.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with these at all and I can't see myself recommending them to anyone. Given that my own dog wouldn't eat hers, I definitely won't consider buying them in the future.<br /><br />Edit: Leaving my original review intact, but reducing from 2 stars to 1. I just heard that the dog that liked these the most was chewing on it a while after I went home and started whimpering. Her owners found that her gums were bleeding. It might just be a random thing that she bit at it wrong and no fault of the treat, but given the other problems people have reported having with these I wouldn't want to gamble on it. I'm definitely not going to be recommending these to anyone.\n",

I bought it originally to make homemade gummy candy, but it just did not get to like the store bought - which does not reflect on this product. I just didn't do it right. Anyhow, I make it as the direction on the package says and sometimes I will add a bit of agar agar to make it firmer. I pour it into the candy molds such as frogs, bears, and my kids love it. All the flavors are really good and the texture is nice, clean tasting.<br /><br />While it is a better alternative to the conventional Jello made with animal gelatin, it still does have artificial coloring.

I suffer from severe cramps (Yes, I do cry because of it.. I even sometimes ask my sister to punch me in the stomach so that it would take away from the pain!). I have tried prescription pain medication and birth control to alleviate my pain. The prescription pain meds always made me sleepy (which is terrible while I'm at work, or need to drive) and for personal reasons I am not on birth control at the moment. When I wasn't taking either, I would take between 6-10 ibuprofen each day for the first 2 days of my cycle. Don't get me wrong, I still have to take it, but not nearly as much. So far, I have only drank the tea during the cycle, usually about 5 bags each day. I have done this for the past 3 months. But, I am going to start drinking it throughout the month... I'm hoping it will help the initial monstrous pain I get when my cycle decides to surprise me.<br />Also - you can't beat the subscribe and save price.

      "The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is about what you'd expect...it's conditioner and it leaves your hair more soft and manageable than shampoo would on its own. It's a good product and does the job as well as other more expensive brands (and a handful of less expensive ones). It's a thick, rich-looking conditioner, and if I have one complaint, it's that the scent can be a bit overpowering when it's on your hair. It's not a bad scent, but it is a very perfumey, \"cosmetic\" scent. Fortunately what's left behind after rinsing is just a hint of it, so that won't be a problem for most. My hair does seem to be better off for using it, and that's the most important thing (especially some of its renewed strength).<br /><br />As far as the packaging, this gets the same complaint as every other product in the Clear line, and that's the cap being on the bottom of the container. It's not a deal-breaker and is largely a non-issue, but I've received other products in the Clear line with the same bottle design that opened in transit, dumping a good bit of the product into the packaging. Amazon knows this, and takes some precautions (taping the cap on and wrapping the bottles in plastic bags), but it doesn't make this the most shipment-friendly product in the world.<br /><br />Over all, the Clear Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a good product at a decent price. As long as you don't mind the fragrance and it doesn't open during shipping, you'll be satisfied with it.\n",

The powder mixes well, unlike other brands.<br /><br />I recently had purchased the SodaStream soda maker, and use a liquid flavoring, I prepaired the carbonation in the bottle and poured in the Lipton packet .....

Tip:  if your try this tea  carbonated  a light carbonation is advised ...Also, if you want a drink like a light water, just use less from the packet.

      "Overall this is a great product if you are a loose leaf tea drinker.  I say overall because, like most things, there are pluses and minuses.  I have been drinking loose leaf teas for about ten years now.  I would not rank myself as an expert, but I have sampled many varieties and flavors which I suppose gives me some degree of knowledge.<br /><br />I usually purchase a different brand Genmaicha which I have grown accustomed to over the years.  In my research this other tea is about what you would expect from a Genmaicha: loose leaf green tea with roasted brown rice in about a 50-50 ratio.  The Shirakiku I am reviewing now is somewhat different.  This \"Genmai Cha\" (note the spelling difference)seems to consist mostly of roasted brown rice with some loose leaf green tea and the addition of Matcha tea.  If you are not familiar with Matcha tea is is a Japanese tea variety which is commonly used in tea ceremonies.  It is in powdered form and prepared by being whisked into water not brewed and strained like loose leaf tea.  Had I known that this tea was manufactured the way it is I don't think that I would have purchased it.  That said, I am still happy with my purchase and enjoy this tea on a daily basis.<br /><br />My critique of the drinkability of the tea itself is a mixed bag.  The flavor is \"in the neighborhood\" of my usual Genmaicha.  However it is definitely not the same.  The bready flavor of the roasted rice is overpowered by the Matcha tea.  In addition, to me Matcha tea is somewhat akin to instant tea.  Although many may disagree strongly with that statement, it is how I feel.  I simply prefer brewed loose leaf tea, and since I was not aware of the nature of this tea, I suppose I am a little dissapointed.  In the cup the tea is very cloudy.  Genmaicha in general is a cloudy cup due to the rice.  The Genmai Cha is about twice as cloudy, due in part to the Matcha and also the high percentage of roasted rice that I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />The other factors to consider with this tea is the quantity and the pricing.  The Shirakiku comes in two vacuum sealed bricks weighing 2.2 pounds (1 Kilogram) each.  That means that you get about 4.4 pounds of tea in total.  That's a lot of tea!  Which leads me to the price.  After tax and with free shipping through Amazon I paid less than $10.50 per pound of tea.  This is less than half of what I would expect to pay for my usual brand.<br /><br />Overall the tea is a great value.  Cost per pound is very low, but 2 Kilograms is a lot of tea.  And the flavor is very good.  So I would have to say that I took away two stars for the introduction of the Matcha tea, but I added one star for the amazing value this tea offers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost per pound<br />Flavor is very good<br /><br />Cons:<br />4.4 pounds of tea (you will be drinking it for a long time....)<br />Not a true Genmaicha (at least not to purists)<br />Lots of sediment at the bottom of the cup\n",

      "The basic concept is there but someone cut too many corners trying to save a buck.  The plastic stakes should be replaced with simple tent stakes so they could be hammered into hard ground more easily.  These have blunt bottoms.  Why?  It is very hard to hammer these into anything but soft sand.  Also, the wire is a ball of wire instead of a rolling spool. This was a real pain in the ass trying to untangle the ball of wire they give you.  And putting the wire through a tiny hole in the stake?  How about a small spur on each stake that the wire could simply be looped around once to secure it rather than having to thread each one like a needle.  Once it was up it worked and then it didn't.  Probably my fault as if any part of the wire grounds it won't work.  But with the cheap wire and stakes it's hard to get a sturdy run that doesn't touch something.  When it does work it gives a nice shock but the only way to test it is to either zap yourself (or one of your kids) or buy a cheap lamp tester ($8.00)  Again, should be included with this product.  For the money this chould be a lot more user friendly.\n",

The ham itself, tasty..but I can get just as nice locally from let's say CostCo or Honeybaked Hams.  Three stars seems low, but four doesn't quite seem right either given it's not exceptional.  Maybe I was just expecting too much and maybe based on that it should be a four or five star product, it very much is tasty.

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

      "We've been enjoying McCormick's crock-pot chilli for some time now so I thought why not try this newest recipe. Of course it's simple: chicken ( I use thighs with skin removed ), a couple cans of stewed tomatoes ( plain is good, Italian better ), can of tomato paste and a half pound of sliced mushrooms. That's it. I put these ingredients in my slow cooker around noon time. A while later ( 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low per the instructions ) it's ready. It can be eaten as is or, as we do, put on top of spaghetti. Sometimes to make it even more like spaghetti sauce I'll add a can of marinara ( Hunt's works well ) which is just the right touch and stretches the sauce base.<br /><br />  This dish isn't what you'd call 'gourmet' but when time is an issue using this mix will definitely make life easier. The only down side to using thighs I find is pulling out the bones and other things not wanted. But thighs are inexpensive and tasty. I've also used chicken breast sliced into long strips which is better if you have young ones who just want to dive in and can't watch for those unwanted items.<br /><br />  Along with the chilli mix and the beef stew mix ( both get eaten very quickly around here ) the Italian Herb mix is a good kitchen tool to have when a wholesome, quick meal is called for. It's easily modified to taste and keeps you coming back for more. And buying these mixes from Amazon in bulk packs almost cuts the cost in half compared to individual packs bought at large food stores. Can't beat that!\n",

      "I've tried to write this review three times now, and every time I get a power blip or something happens to the browser and I lose it.  One more time.<br /><br />I made this carefully, and it is not tasty.  It has a big packet of spices that has a lot of whey, onion, and cheese and spices like black pepper are lower than an ingredient that is listed as \"not more than 2%.<br /><br />I've eaten tasty mac and cheese, and I've even eaten decent hamburger helper, like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ59EQ\">Hamburger Helper, Cheesy Nacho, 7.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  That stuff is cheaper and tastes better.<br /><br />This stuff is easy to make.  You brown one pound of beef (I weighed it to be sure I was following directions) and then drain it (pouring out the tasty juices, I won't do that again), then add the misnamed seasoning packet and the pasta, along with two cups of water.<br /><br />Bring it to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 11-13 minutes.<br /><br />Then remove from the heat and mix in the velveeta packet.<br /><br />They suggest that you add lettuce?  Or chopped tomatoes, so I added Ro-Tel to part of it - the other part I kept pristine so that I could taste it as made.  I used hot Ro-Tel, and, other than the flavor of the Ro-Tel it was bland.  I have to think that the pasta is sort of bland and the spicing in the packet is lacking.  It could have some more onion flavor, or more than 0.5% garlic or something.<br /><br />The value in this is what I believe to be parboiled pasta that can be cooked in this fashion.<br /><br />The net weight of this stuff is 12.8 ounces - with a pound of beef, it makes 5 one cup servings.  My wife guesses that it serves three adults, or six-eight toddlers (if you were making lunch for a day care, say).<br /><br />Now, this is my suggestion:<br /><br />Suppose you buy a piece of velveeta in the store, some cream, some beef, and a little garlic powder, some onion powder, and some pasta.<br /><br />Cook a quarter pound of pasta in one pan, boiling and draining normally, and then brown a pound or two of beef with a bunch of onion and garlic powder, to taste.  In a third pan (or in the one you boiled the pasta in), grate or cube about a pound of Velveeta and heat it gently with a 2 tbsp of butter, stirring frequently until melted, then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream a little at a time while stirring. Add a little white pepper and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, if you like it. Or use sour cream instead of whole cream, or put a little beef broth into the beef after it has browned.<br /><br />Now combine the cheese sauce, the pasta (use more or less to taste, the beef (please don't drain it unless you are on a low fat diet, and then do so carefully - if you have one of those old fat brushes, use that, try to save the juices).  Then add a whole can of Ro-Tel, to your family's taste, hot, mild, lime-chili, whatever.  Taste it - and if it is bland, fix it.<br /><br />Dust the top with paprika before serving it.<br /><br />This dish will taste good, and it won't take you much longer to make it than it would to start with this mix.  And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.<br /><br />Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.  And there is nothing wrong with this stuff except that it is just tasteless, and almost anyone can do better.  Seriously, YOU can do better than this bland product.  If you like Velveeta, use it. If you don't like Velveeta, well, making it yourself allows you to make your cheese sauce from a different type of cheese.  Mexican melting cheese is good.  Heck, Sargento six cheese is great.<br /><br />If you don't want to do it yourself, save money and buy Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I can't rate this less than 3 stars, far as I can tell, it is wholesome and it doesn't actively taste bad. It doesn't actively taste of much at all.  So it gets three stars, and a suggestion that you can do so much better by doing it yourself that you should try.<br /><br />If I had some of this stuff I had to use, I'd:<br /><br />Add a half tsp of white pepper, a half tsp of paprika, garlic powder to taste and onion powder to taste.  I might consider a knorr garlic cube.  Or Chipotle.  I would always add the Ro-Tel, this is the biggest fix you can make to this stuff. Paprika to dust the top before serving.  And, well, beef broth instead of water - that \"seasoning\" is really, really bland. A dollop of sour cream when you put the cheese sauce in, and a tablespoon of butter.<br /><br />Because as shipped, it is horribly bland.\n",

      "**Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.<br /><br />Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward \"Eddie\" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.<br /><br />\"Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?\"  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. \"If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!\" and \"Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?\"<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed \"Thumper\" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. \"If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!\" formed the basis of what is now known as \"The Thumperian Principle\" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, \"Suck My Carrot\", \"Young Bunny Coed Love\", and finally, \"The Bunny Hole\".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the \"Shake A Leg Foundation\" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.\n",

      "I tried a few dry food brands after the pet food recall of 2007.  I tried some grain free, and noticed some problems from the cats.  I tried going all wet - but apparently - my 17 yo needs some of the grains in dry food,  Their main food of choice (I'm not much of one for switching - had trouble with Turkey and Salmon flavors) is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0\">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>.<br /><br />I started with this Dry when it was Eagle Pack Holistic Select.  The formula was EU certified (which has a higher degree of ingredient integrity than US pet foods).  Since then, this company merged with the new owners of Wellness - so the 2 brands can compliment each other.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />EDIT: 3/24/2011<br />I've switched some things up since the Wellness problems (and still waiting for Wellness Chicken Recipe to Return).<br /><br />I have started rotation feeding wet food, and have found that I use less dry food than before - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY\">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Will be giving the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0\">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> a try.<br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248\">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (Also not grain free, and Multi protein source. It does contain Herring. However, cats have reacted positively to this food).<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).  For saving Vet Bills - it pays to have kitties on a high quality diet.<br /><br />PS - the bag comes with its own zip lock closure, I've never had a problem with spoilage nor a-toxins.<br />PPS - some have found this a good rotation ONLY, it eases the budget: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6\">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.\n",
