      "Love the Tassimo and love the Starbucks, especially the Verona!  When \"brewed\" it's fresh, bold, and rich!  I've wanted a pod-style coffee maker for a long time but just wasn't fully satisfied with the Keurig and others.  Don't get me wrong, they're good, just not as good as the price.  I lucked out and bought a Tassimo on clearance which introduced me to their line of coffees and will attest that all the Starbucks coffees are phenomenal!  It is seriously like going to Starbucks but for a fraction of the cost!  And no lines!<br /><br />Here's the awesome part of buying the pods through Amazon: you always get free shipping for your books... essentially.  You can always use coffee and since the Tassimo counts toward the $25 and free shipping, you can buy that one book or item you've been contemplating since we all know Amazon is about the cheapest place to buy new books, but, if you're like me, I always wait until I have enough books to hit the $25 minimum.  Now it's not an issue!  Another tip for you Tassimo folks out there: Target is about the cheapest place to buy the Starbucks house or breakfast blends.  The current price at my local Target is $7.89.  Everywhere else, including Amazon, they're $10+.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

Could have sworn it said 3-5 business days during checkout.  Every company is different and of course Penguin Mints cannot control the mail, but this time span just doesn't work for me.  The company can add their comments if they like, but that doesn't change the fact that I am unsatisfied with my experience.  I order from and through amazon.com once a month or so for the past 2yrs, and in my experience, it takes 7 calendar days or less to receive my products.  Besides, I've had better quality of the same product from a different company.  I tried Penguin Mints because they were cheaper.\n",

These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.

      "I have to admit when I read 'made from dried coconuts...melts in your mouth\", I thought this would be freeze-dried coconut bits for snacking. I did not expect the jar of heaven instead........<br /><br />I reviewed Artisana 100% Organic Raw Coconut Butter -- 16 oz, I've used it as my go-to spread for flax seed microwave muffins, and especially love it in yellow curry (or any curry for that matter!). I had not found another brand that I liked better for taste. Until now.<br /><br />I've been a faithful user of Nutiva coconut oil for a long time, buying it by the 5 gallon pail. If you love Nutiva coconut oil, imagine that wonderful coconut smell amplified a thousandfold. Imagine now, the coconut manna, which TASTES like that smell. It's so good, you can actually eat it on a spoon straight out of the jar. It does not have the high particulate content like the Artisana, instead this is very smooth and creamy yet it's substantial in your mouth. It also made my curry recipe FINALLY taste like the one from the Thai restaurant that we gave up for budgetary reasons.<br /><br />If you are searching for THE perfect coconut butter, THIS is your stuff! Don't even bother wasting a cent on any other brand, get this! There are instructions on the jar for tempering in case your product separates, but mine arrived perfectly blended even though the outside temperature was way above its melting point. It was easy to scoop out (and eat right out of the jar). I even put some of this on top of my sunny-side-up eggs right before removing from the skillet, and it made them taste even better!<br />Love this and it will forever be on my reorder list! THANKS NUTIVA for yet another great product!\n",

      "I first discovered PG Tips when I was researching what kind of tea one of my British characters would have imported to the Midwestern university where he reigned as President. (Dudley, from This Brilliant Darkness <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1466368039\">This Brilliant Darkness</a>) That was when I discovered that PG Tips was the best-selling British tea. Upon editing, that detail got cut, but I never forgot.<br /><br />A few years later, I was delighted to find PG Tips on the shelf of my local grocery, in the imported foods section. I bought some to try, because I am a tea \"whore.\" I always have upward of two dozen varieties of tea in the house at any given time--a situation that my then-coffee-addicted, then-boyfriend Tim found ridiculous.<br /><br />As soon as Tim tried PG Tips, all that changed.<br /><br />I now subscribe to recieve two extra-large boxes of PG Tips every few months. Tim takes a box to work and uses the rest here. He can't live without it. Also, we are extremely happily married, and he spoils me with whatever I want. Coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />I have consequently become addicted to K Cups--but that's a different story.<br /><br />For the record, this & Earl Grey are the only teas Tim likes...so me and my 22 other varieties go the iced tea route & don't try to come between him & his Elixir of Life.<br /><br />Thank you, PG Tips, for making our lives complete.\n",

My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of \"lemon\" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: \"Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy.\" I don't understand \"Contains: Soy\", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.\n",

      "I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.  I hope you found an alternative that you were happy with feeding.\n",

      "I received 1 bottle of Taco Ball Jalapeno Sauce as part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program.  Being a lover of all things spicy, especially jalapeno flavored, I was eager to try this product. It says on the bottle that it's to be used on tacos, taco salads and wraps.  I tried it on roast turkey in a pita - the closest to those things I had in my house.<br /><br />A 2 tablespoon serving size is 110 calories, which is probably a generous portion for most people as the spiciness of the sauce is noticeable with very little used. I wouldn't label it 'hot', but mild heat definitely comes through.  Similar to the heat found in Taco Bell's hot sauce, but jalapeno flavor.  Very light green in color, the sauce has the consistency of Ranch dressing.  When tasting it I noted the heat right away and then the jalapeno flavor, which I liked.  What I didn't like was that the longer it was in my mouth, the more it tasted 'sweet' to me.<br /><br />I could see where some will really enjoy this sauce on a taco salad in addition to sour cream and guacamole, but for me the sweetness isn't a flavor I enjoy with Mexican dishes.  I like a bit of 'tart' versus sweet and I'd rather stick with non-creamy varieties of sauces made with jalapeno like salsa verde, or salsas like hot pico de gallo.\n",

      "Since Neuro Bliss screwed up their formula, I tried this out as a replacement.  One man's meat is another man's poison, so I suppose you can never tell if something like this will work for you unless you try it.  In my case, though, I've been getting different results.  The first 3 or 4 times I tried it, I almost fell asleep (so, as it says on the can, don't drink before driving).  Other times, it would just relax me.  Once or twice, it even made me agitated, and a few times it barely seemed to have any effect at all.  All these attempts were usually a couple of days and sometimes a couple of weeks apart, so I don't think I'm building up a tolerance to it.  A 12 ounce can contains 43.5 grams of pure cane sugar, so you probably don't want to drink it before you go to bed.\n",

      "This review refers to Living Harvest Hempmilk - Unsweetened Original - 32oz fl. oz<br /><br />So when I saw this at my local grocery, right next to my favorite soymilk display, my first thought was, what is it?, and will I get arrested for buying it? I considered it it any case, as I love my soymilk and use it in any meal instead of milk, but there was one instance where soy wasn't working for me. That was in my coffee. Soy breaks up in hot coffee and looks ugly, so I was using Lactaid(Lactose free milk)for that.The Hempmilk was on sale - usually costing twice as much as the soy product - so I said what the hemp, and bought a carton of the unsweetened(as I do with the soy).<br /><br />so first things first - what is hemp? - From the back of the box - \"... transforms tiny hemp seeds into the creamiest and delicious hemp milk you can buy.....\" - still what is it? I had to get out my trusty Webster's - d.'Indian plant of which the fiber is used to make rope.'- as well as other stuff I HEARD about. Anyway so this is made from the seed of that plant. And according to the box it is packed with lots of vitamins. It's a good source of Vit A, Calcium Vitamin D,Ribolflavin, B12, and Phosphorus. It has 0 sugar, 0 cholesterol and only 1g total carbohydrate. All good stuff.<br /><br />So far okay, but here come the two big tests for me - taste, and how did it fare in my coffee. I thought the taste wasn't anything speical, kind of like nothing - white water, and that's exactly how it was in my coffee as well. Not very creamy(as promised), it just barely changed the color of my coffee to brown from black. Although I have to say it did not break up the way the soy does, but it wasn't creamy or tasty enough to switch over from soy for me - and the higher price wasn't getting any points either.<br /><br />Also, there is only 1g of protein. That about did it for me. The soy has 9g. There are some nutrients that are higher in the Hemp(the Vit A and C for instance) - but I get plenty of that in the food I eat.<br /><br />I would say, if for some reason soy is not working for you, you may want to give this a try. It may not be as rich and creamy as stated, but it doesn't taste bad, and it does supply some good nutrients.(Which is why it gets 3 stars from me - okay, but nothing to write home about) But for those who love your soymilk - no reason to switch here.<br /><br />Here are all the ingredients(from the box):<br />Hemp Nut Base(Filtered water),Hemp nut(shelled hemp seed),natural flavors,tricalcium phosphate,carrageenan,sea salt,vita palmitate,vitD2,riboflavin,vitB12<br /><br />By the way, the ingredients on my soymilk box is , filtered water, organic soybeans<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI6BI\">Westsoy Soymilk, Unsweetened Original, 64-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />So remember to breathe, eat healthy and..enjoy.....Laurie\n",

It is very easy to mix (two TB powder with one TB water) and this  makes two TB of  creamy peanut butter and is only 45 calories. (I think REAL peanut butter is about 190). I was amazed  and very pleasantly surprised with the authentic peanut butter taste and consistency. Two TB is plenty to make a sandwich or a topping for another food. I even had my husband try it, as he loves the extra chunky, fat-filled kind. His words....\"not bad!\" He won't be eating it, but he doesn't need to watch his waistline anyway. For someone who does, it's a great substitute.  I just ordered a large bag!\n",

We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead.\n",

      "I received a pack of Newman's Pomegranate Licorice today.  They are curiously addictive.  I thought the flavor was not that strong, but definitely hit the taste buds.  In the past, I've had licorice that left an aftertaste, but this one did not do that.  They are not high sugar, provided that you do not gobble the entire pack in one sitting.  I do need to say that I have never been a big fan of licorice, flavored or otherwise.  That is why this orginal treat surprised even myself.  I'd definitely recommend it.

She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly \"Everlasting\". Darn it!

If this is something that would fit your taste then go for it, but I personally did not feel any energy from drinking this just the sweetness.<br /><br />Be cautioned if you are purchasing this product that it is sweet tasting and it did not have the extra energy you might be wanting or needing throughout your day.

I like to use the same tea k-cup 2-3 times to make iced tea and with Twinnigs it doesn't work because there is so little tea in the k-cup (I suppose that's why it is so finely ground - so they can use less) that it ends up too dilute.  With Timothy's Earl Grey, on the other hand, there is much more tea in the k-cup which allows for my reuse of 2-3 times and the grounds don't end up in the cup.

These seem to be American-made and of good quality. The most impressive thing is what happened when I gave my big Airedale a treat for the first time. I filled her bowl per usual, put on of these in along with a few other treats. I then left the room to feed my other dog. She inhaled this and then abandoned the rest of her plate, without touching it, so she could find me to beg for more. I have never seen her abandon her plate before. I then fed my Beagle one and the Airedale tried to take it out of her mouth. Bottom line is my doggies go nuts for these. They are pricey but the dogs are so happy it is worth it!\n",

      "I would agree with stoney's review. I purchased a 5 lb. bag directly from Coffee Bean Direct using my Amazon account. Which makes it convenient to buy directly from them and the roasting dates are within a few days of your order.<br /><br />5 lbs. is a lot of coffee for one person. So I bagged 10-12 bulging full plastic baggies and put them in the freezer for use when needed. It would take too long for one person to finish the 5 lb. bag within a few weeks.<br /><br />But the smell was awesome when I packed the baggies. My apt. smelled like a coffee house for days, awesome!<br /><br />The beans are a dark brown color, slight oily sheen, smells great when grinding, best part of the day actually, the taste is good, bold like, or strong depending on how much coffee/water you use, lets you know you are drinking real coffee, I like it.<br /><br />I use the drip method, a single cup Melitta plastic drip cone right over the cup, brown paper filters. Less parts to break, simple clean up.<br /><br />I also tried a 1lb. bag of \"Smoked Coffee\" from Coffee Bean Direct. It does have that strong smoked smell to it, and it's good coffee, but I couldn't say that I tasted that smoked flavor in the coffee.<br /><br />But I like the City Roast, has good flavor.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.

      "Just an FYI to all those who have a smart dog like me -- this may not last as long as you hope. I've tried them all and am on a mission to find soemthing that will keep my pup entertained for a little while and won't break. Kongs don't last for Kobe and as much as he loves squeaky stuffed toys, they don't last more than 10 minutes. Gosh, did I mention he's barely 7 months old - can't fathom how much smarter he will get. SIGH. OK, so you've got an idea what my dog is like onto my review.<br />So I've seen these things both online and at pet stores, and always felt a little unsure about these things. For one thing, these things aren't cheap and two like I've described I've got a really smart Lab. So I broke down and bought this at the pet store after a worker I spoke with highly recommended it. Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a \"chewer.\" Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball. Next thing, he had it out again and this time he chewed a good chunk of it so it no longer fit. So I put it in the inner part of the ball and minutes later he got it out of there too. S-I-G-H.<br />I take off 1 star because in my case it was everlasting. I do give it credit for being pretty durable and the treat took a little while longer for him to eat. Also, it's got a cave you can bury treats in which isn't as easy for them to get things out of. I say it's OK.\n",

      "If you're gonna make Macaroni and Cheese from a box, this is the way to go.  Velveeta Shells and Cheese can be prepared very quickly and has a very creamy taste.  That's because you're actually using the cheese sauce Velveeta is famous for and not that powdered stuff common with other boxes.  You will only need to boil water, put the shells in and cook until tender.  Once you drain the water, squeeze in the cheese and (I recommend) let it set for a few minutes, so the cheese can set.  I also enhance the flavor a bit by adding some sharp cheese.  I can't make enough for my preschooler.  We all love it!\n",

      "If syrup isn't real maple, I don't bother. I think it's a travesty to use non-maple syrup on pancakes. I also flavor my oatmeal, oat bran, cookies, soy yogurt, and lots of other things with maple syrup. I especially like the Grade B, because you get the deeper, richer maple flavor, and less of the pure sweetness of the Grade A. My father loves maple syrup, and I bought this as a gift for him. He had never had the B before, and now he's converted too. This is kind of expensive, but I really think it's worth the price. Per ounce, you're saving money--it's a half gallon! YUMMY!\n",

      "I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.\n",

Found out that this is not true with this tea. The tea comes well packaged and is very much a whole leaf tea but when I took a smell I smelled something that suggested it was tea. I immediately became worried and made a cup the next morning and soon discovered how bad the tea was. The tea has the orange color of Irish Breakfast but there is scarcely any aroma or flavor.

There was a tea undertone, but the basic taste was honey, which also overwhelmed the mango & pineapple, which was negligible.  I drank it all over 1/2 hour.  Iced tea more or less it is, but the honey flavor is king.  Of course, it is not \"sticky\" like real honey.<br /><br />I don't know.  I prefer others to this.

      "The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.\n",

      "Now that I understand something of bonsai basics (i.e. treat outdoor plants to a life outdoors so as not to kill them!), I've decided to begin this hobby / art form with a Juniper bonsai. After browsing the great variety of Juniper bonsai trees available on Amazon, I settled on this plant because I thought it had a pleasing shape, was described as having \"full\" growth, and comes in a distinctive stoneware pot. For the price, $38, it appeared to be the most mature and well-styled tree that I could find, and I didn't want to spend significantly more for my first tree.<br /><br />I ordered the bonsai on Monday (which, granted, was a holiday). The bonsai shipped on Thursday via USPS Priority Mail. This struck me as somewhat slow processing, and I would recommend to the seller that they ship by USPS only Monday through Wednesday to avoid live plants sitting in mail processing facilities over the weekend. This is a tip that I always follow when I ship live plants, and it ensures that plants shipped anywhere in the contiguous 48 states arrive in the same week they were shipped. Fortunately, my bonsai arrived on Saturday, so it didn't have to spend a dark day in a box. This, however, is my only even slightly negative comment.<br /><br />The bonsai itself was larger and more full than I had expected. It stands close to 11\" in an approximately three inch deep pot. The pot is a lovely silvery green which perfectly complements the juniper foliage. The bonsai does not appear to have been freshly potted in response to my order: the trunk feels stable within the pot, implying good root growth, and the bonsai is potted with a rock and established moss. The pot was labeled with a sticker to identify which view was the front, and the bonsai was shipped with a small package of organic fertilizer. Bonsai from this seller also come with with a \"Thriving Bonsai\" DVD. I have not yet watched the video, but I appreciate the care that the seller extends to the bonsai novice. This seller clearly wants the bonsai to be properly fed, appreciated, and cared for in its new home.<br /><br />I am very pleased with my purchase, and would highly recommend purchases from this seller.\n",

These bottles are a bit more expensive than what you would purchase in the store so that is why I gave it a 4. In many areas, you can't find these in stores either. I purchased them because our stores recently started carrying the plastic Voss bottles vs. the glass which is not desired.

      "My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from \"crisp and delicious\" to \"overpowering and slightly off-putting\". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.\n",

      "*****<br /><br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent \"natural flavors\" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague \"natural flavors\" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, \"The Reincarnation of Tea\". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some \"natural flavors\" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these \"natural flavors\" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor.\" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as \"grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"vegetative, popcorn\".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br /><br />*****\n",

      "With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.\n",

However, the taste is just funny.  There is something to this coffee that is similar to other instant coffees.  There is only a hint of that Starbucks goodness IMHO.

When this last bag arrived and I opened it, I knew right away it was bad. It smelled like plastic instead of the wonderful aroma of fresh roasted coffee beans, and the beans look stale. So I have cancelled my subscription and will go back to ordering our beans from our local organic food buying club through UNFI.

      "We tried this package's brother first, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052F8JXI\">Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac</a>.  This one was better; my wife and kids agree.  We will definitely look for this one again, but will pump it up to better suit our personal tastes.<br /><br />Although the instructions say one pound of chicken, I went for poultry broke and used a package of 2.47 pounds.  Yes, call me wild, reckless, impetuous, whatever.  Given the fact that the instructions for the amount of water are based on what the orzo and broccoli will soak up, the extra chicken didn't do anything to the recipe, and actually made the finished dish a lot better.  So, I advise that you use at least two pounds of chicken when you cook this kit.<br /><br />Also, the instructions advise to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces.  I did that, and they came out pretty big, as in pretty big bite-size.  I advise to cut the chicken into ½-inch pieces, and you'll get better distribution throughout the dish.  Smaller pieces also will cut the cooking time.<br /><br />It cooks up just fine, although my cooking time was quite a bit more than indicated on the box.  Total time for me, from the first of the chicken browning until serving was about an hour.  Consider, though, that I used more chicken than advised which likely affected the overall cooking time as indicated on the box's directions.  Yes, it was worth the prep time and wait.<br /><br />The seasoning ingredients are passable, smelling in the pouch an awful lot like canned parmesan cheese, with a hint of celery and parsley.  The orzo plumped up very nicely and filled out the dish well.  The broccoli florets were the only real surprise in the package, coming in a very small envelope and coming out a lot more like ground-up spice bits than the broccoli I thought I'd be getting.  Actually, the box's depiction is about right in terms of broccoli size and distribution.  This package's broccoli will not suffice for your USDA-recommended vegetable intake; it lends color and a small amount of texture to the dish, but to my experience offered no additional taste.  The product's title is \"chicken and broccoli,\" but the ratio is far from equal.<br /><br />The Velveeta cheez pouch was squishy and cheezy and ample; I was surprised by the amount of cheez I was squeezing into the dish.  But hey, it melted down just fine and mixed in with the dish in no time, glomming it all together super-American-style.  As it did this, I was thinking that mixing it with some cream of mushroom soup, dropping the entire thing into a casserole dish, covering it with a top layer of cheez and some fried onions would really make this something cool; I'll have to try this.  Your results may vary.<br /><br />Taste: This stuff was just fine by itself, although my wife noticed immediately that it was pretty bland.  Like, really bland.  Given that I was cooking this for a review, I intentionally did not experiment with the kit (other than my highly irresponsible and psychotically dangerous use of twice the amount of recipe-specified chicken, and a good three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to cook the chicken, and I didn't drain it, leaving the juices and olive oil to join the dish, which  I recommend you do, too).  Yeah, it's pretty bland, but not bad at all, and it's got a lot of potential.  So, I recommend that you up-spice it to fit your own personal needs.  That might mean some salt and pepper.  If and when I make this again, I'll saut&eacute; some onions with the chicken, maybe add some fresh sliced mushrooms, and I'll definitely drop in some garlic, black pepper, caraway seeds, and maybe even a dash of powdered cayenne pepper to give this dish some action.<br /><br />Bottom line: in the dinner kit market, this one isn't really that remarkable.  Follow the simple instructions and you'll end up with a suitably tasty and largely unremarkable dinner for 3 or 4.  But, make a few tweaks for your personal tastes, and you'll end up with something much better.\n",

      "I got these to make as a surprise gift for my son.  The kit came with everything I needed including the marshmallows.  The directions were super easy, and they turned out FANTASTIC!  The jar of sprinkles they give you is huge, we still have half of them left over but BE CAREFUL WHEN OPENING IT!!! I popped the top off and tiny little sprinkle dots went all over my kitchen.  Let me tell you, those things are NOT easy to sweep up.  The only other issues I had were that there was only enough melted chocolate to make 10 pops, not 12 and I didnt realize I was going to need wax paper or a drying rack for them but that was an easy fix.  I took the box that amazon sent them to me in, flipped it upside down and covered it with aluminum foil.  Then I poked 12 holes in the box with a meat thermometer and sprayed the foil with some cooking spray so the pops wouldnt stick to it.  After coating each pop in chocolate and sprinkles I stuck the stick in one of the holes I had made in the box and it worked perfectly.  They did take about 3-4 hours to completely harden but after that I just stuck them in a ziplock baggie and stored them in my cabinet. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to make a special treat for their loved ones, or a fun project to do with the kids.  In the store or in a bakery these puff pops cost $2 or more EACH!!!! I was amazed at the value I got with this product in comparison with similar products.  DEFINITELY add these to your cart shoppers!  You wont be sorry.\n",

This is saying a lot since I'm a vegetarian.  It was much easier to open than canned cat food I've given my cat before.  Instead of having to dish out the food with a spoon or plopping it into and desirable lump in my cats bowl, I just removed the top and poured it out hassle free.

Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner!

      "Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />Prior to trying this, I enjoyed the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40\">kiwi berry</a> flavor. I thought it would have paired well with a pastry, so this time around I tried the watermelon strawberry whilst snacking on a strawberry Pop Tart. You might think that's too much berry at one time, but they go well together. What I'm not thrilled about is that by itself the drink tastes like Jolly Rancher candy in liquid form. It's a bit tart. But the can is cool - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling.\n",

      "What a disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I bought peaches and strawberries flavor in my grocery store because they were on sale. I noticed they were the most expensive ones there so I figured that must be the best there is. How wrong was I. First thing that hit me was how sweet they were. I could barely finish eating. Then I looked at the label and found far too many artificial ingredients. But that's not all. I noticed that peaches and strawberries are strangely similar in taste and shape. After reading a label I found out that they do not even put real strawberries and peaches in the oatmeal. Can you believe that? The most expensive oatmeal on the market and no real fruit. What they do is they put artificially flavored apples in there. Company with such experience in oatmeal making can't afford to give its customers REAL FRUIT? What a shame. I will never buy any of their products. Never!. Oh just to compare what there is available on the market please visit Traders Joe. I found blueberry flavor with REAL blueberries, cranberry with REAL cranberries. So it is possible to make a great product you just have to make an effort QUAKER and stop fooling your customers.\n",

It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber).

Since I don't drink coffee in the morning, I was in search of a drink to give the me caffeine I needed in the morning.<br /><br />The taste and the variety of the tastes are great. I particularly like orange and cola.<br />I have noticed this drink actually improves my mood<br />No post drink crash I experience with RockStar and other energy drinks<br />No calories<br />No aspartame<br />The energy is sustained throughout the day.<br /><br />I take half a can in the morning and then another half around 4 pm ( I do go to the gym around 1pm however i consume another pre-workout drink for that).<br /><br />Try different flavors. Happy Celsius drinking :)\n",

      "The MIO Peach Tea flavor is definitely a fuzzy, peachy flavor and, if you put too much flavoring into the water, your tongue will feel more fuzzy!  Seriously, this flavor is just plain bad.<br /><br />The flavor also tastes chemically, and, after looking at the ingredients, it is easy to see why - the ingredients are entirely chemicals.  This product also contains sucralose, a sweetener that some want to avoid.<br /><br />Verdict: if you want flavored water, are looking for an enhancer, and the chemical list doesn't bother you, the MIO bottles are something to look at.  I prefer <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY\">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> over the Peach Tea because the Sweet Tea has a smoother flavor.<br /><br />Edit: my teenagers were excited to try this product because of TV advertisements.  One squirted a healthy dose of flavoring into her water & promptly stated that the peach flavor tastes like chlorine.\n",

      "My 6 Greyhounds received the chicken pot pie flavored treats as an early Easter surprise from their Auntie. Keeping in mind the size of my dogs, these treats are the teeniest, tiniest things I think I've seen. Maybe an inch long and 1/8\" high/deep, the dogs' canine teeth are bigger than these treats. Keeping in mind a treat this small will most likely be swallowed whole, I distributed them slowly to each pup. It was as if they were gulping air...I don't think the ones with enough teeth to chew even tasted them. The 2 with minimum teeth for whom I must moosh everything up got theirs crushed up in yogurt...those two girls wouldn't eat the yogurt. So, I can't tell if my pups like these or not; most didn't even taste them as they went down the hatch too quickly without chewing; the other two didn't like what they did to their favorite treat since losing their teeth, yogurt.<br /><br />They are wheat and corn free, listed as 100% natural and the ingredients list on the back of the little box are:<br />oat flour, rolled oats, potato flour, chicken broth, carrots, celery, canola oil, eggs, baking powder<br /><br />For the price, one can put those ingredients together at home (I will swap potato flour for whole wheat flour) and bake them yourself. Even if it takes a few tries to get the measurements right, the dogs will still eat them and you can make them any size that is appropriate for your pet(s). If baking them as hard treats is too time consuming for you, do what I do: mix it up like a meatloaf, bake it, cut into appropriately sized treat pieces, and keep in the frig. Easy enough and one can use leftovers from a meal rather than start with all new ingredients. Probably healthier for your pet too.<br /><br />However, we must still thank Auntie for allowing us to try something new. If it were not for the tiny size of these treats, they would most likely have been a great big hit here.\n",

      "The manufacturer of this shampoo states that men's scalps are different than females' and men require a male shampoo. They may be correct. CSI-type programs inform us that forensic experts can tell the difference between male and female hair. This \"scalp therapy\" is designed to be a shampoo and conditioner for men, as well as an anti-dandruff treatment. It is supposed to give users a \"cooling affect\" and leave \"hair feeling ultra-fresh.\" I guess by hair they mean the scalp. The manufacturers put nutrients into the shampoo, including, among many others, ginseng, mint, vitamin B5 and E, and sunflower oils.<br /><br />I have been using Head and Shoulders for several decades and this shampoo worked for me, even though it is not designed for a specific sex. I didn't have dandruff after I started using it. Therefore, I can't testify whether this treatment stops dandruff. I did not notice a \"cooling affect\" or feel my scalp \"feeling ultra fresh\" with this new product. The only difference that I noticed was that the therapy cream felt creamier, oilier. My wife tells me that my hair smells fresh after using both shampoos.<br /><br />I noticed that others who received the shampoo through the amazon vine program, like me, also, like me, received a bottle that had leaked. I don't know why this happened. I cleaned up the bottle and kept it turned upside down to see if it continued to leak. It stopped leaking.<br /><br />In short, as far as I can tell, the two shampoos are substantially alike. I am unable to comment whether the new shampoo's many additional ingredients improved my hair or scalp in any way.\n",

      "I LOVE these noodles and I really enjoy them in place of ramen. For those dieting, Ramen is the worst thing you can eat, boasting 65% of your daily saturated fat due to the palm oil. To prepare, I rinse well with hot water or drop in boiling water for a minute (best) the let dry. As for flavoring, I find these to work best in \"Soup\" applications with strong flavors. Like tofu, these will absorb whatever they are cooked in. My fave and easiest method is to simply sacrifice a $0.20 Run of the mill beef ramen, steal the flavor pack, and cook my noodles in the broth. I also add  Heinz reduced sugar ketchup to add body to the sauce and give it a lip smacking goodness. A bit frugal, but it is really good. I have given this to other people and they dont even realize its not the real deal. Prep, Boil, Add to flavorful broth. Done.\n",

I like to be able to add as much as I want and only have to carry a bottle of water and my drops to have the perfect drink every time. I found the prices on Amazon were not cheaper than going to the store. I buy about 10 a month and always have left over so I feel good buy since they can last as long as you want pending on how much you put in each time. With the other single serve powders you either have to put the whole amount in or use what you want and hope the powder does not spill out since there is no way to close the packet.

On it's own, my husband didn't care for it (I liked it)...but mix in just a little cocoa pebbles to help get the milk chocolately and you have a big winner for everyone!<br /><br />Now we eat these regularly.

      "I love the portability of this product.  My daughter blessed me with a beautiful grandson in December 2011.  She initially went the breast milk route, but found it to be difficult.  Similac Advance early shield gives my precious gift everything he need as far as nutrition. My daughter lives out of town and we travel back and forth a lot.  The ready to feed is just that, ready when you need it.  The price is comparable to what is in the store.  I order and it is practically there instantly (a day or 2 at the most)and  it allows me to order and send directly to them.  It's my way of helping out and being of help when I am not there.

      "I have ordered several flavors of Fancy Feast Appetizers to use in the rotational feeding of my 4 cats. Flaked Skipjack Tuna is not their favorite. They are a bit spoiled and when the local grocer or drug store has White Albacore Tuna on sale at a dollar a can, or even less, I stock up on the Albacore and give it out on Special occasionas to the kids. Special occasions may be Sundays, holidays, or, any day that I am tired and want to open one big, dense can of food that feeds several mouths!<br />Because they get such nice \"human\" Tuna, I think that kitty Tuna is just a little beneath them on any normal day.<br />Now, I do also feed a Feral Cat and since my indoors guys were reluctant to eat the Skipjack Tuna, I gave it to my Feral kitty. He gets real Albacore only 4 or 5 times a year. He scarfed the Skipjack right up.<br />So, my overall impression of how well a kitty eats this Appetizer Tuna depends upon how much human Tuna is normally put on his plate. If he is not so spoiled as my indoor guys, he will eat it without any reservations.<br />By now, my quest is finding kitty food that is unusual; therefore, new to the kitty palate. In the Fancy Feast Appetizer line, my indoor kittys like the Talapia <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY\">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a> and the white meat chicken <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQKN2\">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, White Meat Chicken, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>. Both of these are 5 store encores for my cats, while the Skipjack is a 4 Star, BUT, if your kitty is not spoiled by Albacore, he should like the SkipJack just fine. I do recommend it, but at my house the Talapia and the chicken are eaten more quickly.\n",

      "Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like \"chicken\" or \"chicken meal\" and  you do not want things like \"meat byproduct.\"  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the \"Holistic\"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.\n",

      "The Schladerer Fruit Brandies chocolates are much MUCH better than anything labelled \"Very Special Chocolates\".  These fruit brandy candies taste like they are made with high quality chocolate while many of the other bottle-shaped candies taste waxy and low-quality.<br /><br />The fruit brandy fillings are nice, and while very sweet they do not seem overly sweet for the candy balance of flavors.  Of course the fillings are not very fruity but you definately get a little whiff of liquor when you bite into one (nice!)<br /><br />On my personal review scale of liquor-filled chocolates:<br />The \"Very Special\" ones are terrible and not worth the time and money (or the calories)<br /><br />The Schladerer are lovely and made with high quality chocolate, a winner<br /><br />The Ausbach brandy chocolates are the best I have ever tried, with even nicer (darker) chocolate and a stronger whiff of liquor in the filling\n",

      "It is completely understandable why Talisker would be Ian Flemming's scotch of choice for the James Bond character (in the books anyway). The spirit of Talisker is like no other single malt. Never subtle and always delicious.<br /><br />The 25 is the most refined, IMHO, and my favorite from this great and uncompromising distillery. Sweet peat, smokey, pepper and ginger spices, rich and fruity, (a touch of spring water brings out some of the floral character), a buttery smooth mouth feel and a long warming finish make this a must try for all single malt enthusiasts. The 25 year old changes a bit in character from year to year but not enough to worry about so seek out any year you can. Because this distillery tends to be overlooked by the masses, the 25 YO is a great value. It is a muscular whisky of great craftsmanship. An real gem of a whisky. Careful though, it is not a starter malt and doesn't take kindly to strangers who rush in. Approach it carefully, introduce yourself slowly and give it a little time to breath or it may bite back! Highly recommended.\n",

      "I tried this blend for the value. It wasn't rank, but it wasn't great...nor did it taste like Kona. My biggest concern is their labeling this as \"Kona,\" when it's really not. Apparently it has some Kona beans in there, but nowhere do they state how much. Online they say their blend is \"private.\" I get the notion that we have a sort of Cracker Jack situation here, with a package full 'o cheap beans and a single little Kona bean waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy down in the bottom like a toy prize.<br /><br />I would give this coffee 2.5 stars based solely on taste and dollar value (compared to plain coffee). I drop it to one star because I don't like companies scamming me. If they want to use a luxury name like Kona, they absolutely need to disclose how much is in there. Ask yourself...does a corporation use a name like Kona and mix it with inferior beans because they want to offer Kona taste at a fair price to you, or is it more likely they're using the Kona name to get more money per pound for the 95%+ other, cheaper beans in the mix? I'm no cynic, but...<br /><br />I would not pay $60,000 for a Ford Taurus with 2% BMW parts...I would not pay $1,000 for a Senseo just because it has a Rancilio drip tray...I would not pay $30 per lb for prosciutto that was mostly Safeway deli ham.

      "I purchased this raw honey, in hopes that it will do wonders for my health and my blemished skin, but my hopes were set up too high.<br /><br />The raw honey does have a unique taste at first but after half way through the bottle, the taste gets annoying. It's not as tasteful as the honey that is sold on grocery stores. This one is more thick and therefore makes it VERY hard to spread around your waffles or pancakes.<br /><br />I read many reviews stating that this honey is good for your health. Well ever since taking it, nothing really changed at all. I've had this honey for months and no significant health improvement of any kind has happen.<br /><br />I was mostly aiming at the skin issues that I have. I heard honey is recommended as a mask to kill bacteria on the skin that could cause blemishes. So with all of the health benefits that this honey was said to have, I trusted that it would not only improve my health but also help fight my acne. Well it sure didn't do a single thing to change my skin condition. Just hours of annoying thick honey on my face. No blemish was stopped, no quickness in fading away the red spots and absolutely no skin improvement of any kind. My skin didn't feel cleaner at all nor did it glow or changed a single thing. A simple soap sure left me more satisfy than putting this on my face day after day in hopes that it would help.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a good product if you are just using it as a substitute for sugar. It has that sweet taste for the sweet tooth. It's thick but if you have time you could warm it up in the microwave or in something hot.<br />THIS IS NOT A HEALTH REMEDY OR ACNE FIGHTING TOOL!!!<br /><br />So if your planning on getting this to help fight acne, I would recommend spending that money for a product that at least labels it self with the ingredients to fight acne.

Bob's Red Mill polenta can be ready in ten minutes and doesn't strike us as pasty. The flavor of De la Estancia is excellent though. I have begun to use it instead of fine cornmeal in baked goods. For example, Martha Stewart has a wonderful,  simple recipe for a blackberry cornmeal cake.\n",

I notice that when I stopped drinking it about 2 months ago I just did not have much desire for sex and when I started drinking it again I feel like im 20 years old again. wink. Now Im not 100% sure its the tea but you have to look at your body like a computer, whenever something seems wrong with it, then go back and figure out what have you taken or stopped taking and problem solved. the taste is not horrible.

It was a hit - which is not always easy with a 14 and a 9 year old!! As another reviewer noted, the recipe comes off the package, and I have the spices in the house, so it will be easy to recreate. There is definitely room for modification if you want to alter it too. We added sour cream at the table, which complimented the food well. You do have to purchase the ingredients of course; this is just the spice. But it was very helpful the first time making it, to have it all premeasured and ready to go.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying.\n",

      "I will be the first to admit that I am not usually one to recommend any of the higher priced soup mixes.  Being a an old time soup maker from way back, I am not at all opposed to soup mixes for I have a couple of them I favor, and are even reviewed here on Amazon. Bobs is probably the most expensive out of the lot however.  I have never bought Bobs mix from Amazon for it is available locally, (and fortunately at the same price Amazon offers it for). Its easy to imagine that a veggie soup mix is just about the easiest blend of mix to come up with.  They pretty much all have the same ingredients as to peas, peppers, corn, etc.  Its just the stock that is usually the random element as to its real flavor and return factor.  Bobs red mill mix however has definitely broken the mold as far as freeze dried veggies.  They have to be the tastiest that I have ever eaten.  And believe me, as an old time camper and hiker with decades of experience with one pot dinners over an open fire, that is definitely going some.  I have tried just about everything that you can buy, and made everything that isn't.  Trust me, Bobs has proven to me that not all dried veggies are anywhere near made the same.  As for the stock, it is very flavorful.  I would have to say just a notch or two below my own stock.  (And trust me again, that is very much going some)!  The only item I should mention is the same thing many other reviewers here have taken note of.  This is a no salt soup mix.  Not low salt, but none at all.  I really think it is going some in the other direction to think someone could eat this without any salt at all and throughly enjoy it.  But considering how really fresh and delicious it tastes, adding your own level of salt is easy, and for some a very convenient alternative. If its variety you favor, consider this mix a base for anything you like.  I have added beef to it, hamburger, chicken, pork, and even Italian sausage and they are all remembered as some of the best meals I have ever eaten.  Franky I think this is the best soup mix I have ever had, plain, or doctored.  I recommend buying it here on Amazon if you can't find it locally.  And that you order enough of it to qualify for the free shipping.  Believe me after you have had this soup once, you will want it again and again.... Highly recommend.\n",

      "Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.\n",

But it is not as good as Ramyun picante and I give ramyun 5 stars.  My boyfriend is german / irish American and he loves these noodles...even this spicy neoguri.

      "Whoah! After the senseo pods because unavailable in any stores I shop at, and getting weird backstock and supply issues from senseos site-ordering, I finally looked at amazon again after a long time, and I found these bad boys! I picked the \"izzy blend\" whatever thats supposed to be, based on the description of the coffee, and its PERFECT. The pods are all oversized, which means when in the single pod brew tray thing, makes an ample amount of really good, creamy coffee. Theyre also all individually wrapped in foil, each like a bulging condom in the wrapper. That keeps them amazingly fresh. This coffee is good, at least the ones I got, really good. When I brew this, people pop out of hiding spaces sniffing around and mutterring \"coffee! coffee... coffeecoffee! that smells like coffee!\" and it does. I love my senseo machine, despite the issues ive had with it, I prefer the idea of ground coffee still instead of weird magical coffee concentrates. I never expected coffee this good to come from that thing! I tried using the \"reuseable pods\" which didnt amount to anything but some watery, slightly foamy, weak dribble. That was with the eco, and the duck, and that other thing. I'm in love with my senseo machine again! If you want creamy coffee, that tastes like COFFEE, without being some kind of awful acid filled starbucks over-coffee, then go for this. Its simply a damn good mug of coffee that does its job when it literally opens my eyes and wakes me up in the morning. Would highly reccomend this to anyone, the coffee is just great, its packaged perfectly, and the oversized pods are something I still cant get over.<br /><br />Thug life homies, may your pencils never dull, your fridge always be full, and may there be plenty of ninjas to snipe in your dreams.<br />Good day.\n",

If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing.  Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then \"fortify\" with synthetic vitamins/minerals.  Pathetic.  Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible.  There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk.  Sorry to be so matter of fact.  I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the \"green\" movement.

      "Pure Ghee is a staple in our home. Although it may seem to be a luxury to spend on a condiment it will become one of those ingredients one cannot live without. I have tried many 'health food' store commercial brands and I have tried to make my own, but they pale in comparison. My 14yo son loves to cook eggs in ghee and is quite disappointed when we are running low and usually adds ghee to our Amazon cart. It is essential for those who follow a GAPS diet, Wise Tradition, or other 'healthy fat' lifestyle. If not, no matter. Pure Ghee tastes great on toast, popcorn and ANY Indian/Indonesian recipe and great for traveling/camping/pack-backing because it doesn't require refrigeration. Some spend on expensive coffee, great wines or cheeses, or other gourmet products, but if we had to choose Pure Ghee always comes first in our home.\n",

      "I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.\n",

You can also eat it dry, but I can't since I'm on a low sodium diet.

ICV D-47 strain was selected from 450 isolates collected between 1986 and 1990.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The ICV D-47 is a low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at the end of fermentation. This strain tolerates fermentation temperatures ranging from 15° to 20°C (59° to 68°F) and enhances mouthfeel due to complex carbohydrates. Malolactic fermentation proceeds well in wine made with ICV D-47.<br /><br />Recommended for making wines from white varieties such as Chardonnay and ros&eacute; wines. An excellent choice for producing mead, however be sure to supplement with yeast nutrients, especially usable nitrogen.<br /><br />An excellent choice for dry whites, blush wines and residual sugar wines.\n",

They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.

It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty. These are perfect for people who want to add more protein to their diet in an easy way. I take a bag to school or on trips and they are awesome, especially good for days when I work out a lot. The price for these is really good too, especially if you score some extra savings with Amazon. As an afternoon snack, these beat anything you'll find in a vending machine price- and health-wise. It is products like this one that make my life a little easier so I don't have to struggle to eat healthy while being busy!\n",

I had my misgivings about this product, as the treats are larger than I expected, two cookie-like squares attached to each other. There is also no powerful or distinct smell of her usual favorite treats, peanut butter or cheese. Yet, every time I give one to her it disappears in seconds!

These are darned tasty to a meat-lover like myself.  Not just these, but the entire line (that I've tried so far).<br /><br />No, you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat-like, despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it, anyway?!).  However, it does have a satisfying chew, and unlike real jerky, you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky, these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh, they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.  And they do a pretty good job on the flavoring, too!<br /><br />Bottom line: it ain't meat, but it's amazing for a plant!\n",

I cooked it up for dinner one night with some veggies and stir fry chicken and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. While the package makes it seem like the product will be light and fluffy, the actual vermicelli was pretty heavy and also like whole wheat angel hair pasta. Now, I love my rice sticky but there's a difference between sticky and glumpy...this was glumpy. I had my partner try it just to make sure that it wasn't just me and she said that she found it to be almost slimy. I added tons of veggies and spices and yet it seems like there was no taste. I have tried this recipe before on brown rice and it's exceptional so I knew it wasn't the recipe I used. I saved the leftovers to have for lunch the next day but when I heated it up, the noodles just got more lumpy and stuck together.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think I had a great experience with this product.

I talked myself into thinking that maybe it's an acquired taste, but finishing my first pouch is turning out to be way too difficult. What a waste of money!! I can't even hand these out to people because I'm sue that no one will want them. Yes, they're that bad.<br />I hope I can use these to make some sort of citrus tea or other drink, or maybe even toss in my salads. I don't know, we'll see. I'm just really disappointed.\n",

Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.

      "My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.\n",

      "I must have somehow \"missed\" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.\n",

      "Anyone knows that if you are going to bake a country ham, you need to soak it.  Soak it in something that will allow the water to cover the ham.  Soak it for 2 days, changing the water twice per day.  I soak mine in a cooler and put some ice in it to keep it fresh.  When I was a chef in a restaurant, I would soak them in the walk-in, still remembering to change the water twice per day.  If you are going to fry the ham and make a red eye gravy, I would slice the ham and only soak the slices for a couple of hours, pat dry and then fry, making sure you do not fry it too much.  If you do, you will find that it becomes extraordinarily salty.<br /><br />For the person who wrote the review in January of 2012, I would suggest two things.  Make sure you read a recipe when you start using a new product, and number two, do not become intoxicated before you type.\n",

These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!

      "After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried \"roasting\" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a \"chocolaty and vanilla\" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.  When I am finished struggling thru this five pound bag, NO MORE..!\n",

This is a much more natural option and has a really wonderful, light caramel-y, slightly nutty and slightly citrus-y sweet flavor! It is sublime-I've NEVER tasted anything as complex & wonderful as Lyle's!! You can only get it in London, Amazon.com, or very pricey gourmet shops. Amazon has the best price!! I read the other reviews and have to admit that if I received a plastic bottle I was going to send it right back! What I received was a glass bottle wrapped several times in bubble wrap packed in a box filled with popcorn! Wonderful stuff!!!\n",

      "This tea is delicious. I had liked the \"Kombucha\" yogi makes, and this is very similar, but better.  It still has kombucha, but the mint flavor is just a tad stronger, which makes it taste more refreshing.  The tea wakes up my brain and helps me study, and is the perfect cure for the morning after a long night out.  The little bit of caffeine also helps me stay awake at work -- I drink about 3 throughout each day. Highly recommended!\n",

      "I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"\n",

The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good.

      "Quaker Oatmeal Squares are smaller in size than one would expect, especially in comparison with some other cereals. The dietary information is encouraging as there is fairly low sodium, 190 mg per 1 cup serving and 5 grams of dietary fiber along with 6 grams of protein.<br /><br />One of the things I first noticed about the cereal was its ability to remain crisp long after some other cereals had given way to sogginess. This is a real plus for my money. The box was 14.5 ounces as advertised and comes in one of those pouches that must be cut with a pair of scissors to open. All told it is a nice alternative to the spoon size shredded wheat and the raisin bran cereal that more frequently winds up on the breakfast menu. Try it, there's a good chance you'll like it.\n",

      "We live in a completely wooded area in NW Wisconsin; woods begin where our lawn ends with the nearest house 1/2 mile away.  We have had \"issues\" with deer, bear, coyotes, raccoons and little ones like rabbits and gophers.  We've tried moth balls, pepper, red pepper flakes, etc.  Nothing really worked on a consistent basis.<br /><br />This does seem to work.  It is obvious when you open it that pepper is the main ingredient.  The container has a built in pour spout, it is convenient but may be larger than really needed and given the price of the Ridder this is important.  It comes out smoothly and is easy to sprinkle around.  But a five pound container does get a little heavy quickly.  We went about a week with no problems around the three flower beds and one tree that I put this on.  Given the amount used this application would have cost about $10.  After some rain I did have to reapply it as I noticed some animals seem to have reappeared, in fairness the Ridder does say this in the instructions.<br /><br />Two caveats:<br /><br />1  Above I repeat the word \"seem\", there is really no concrete way to know for sure, we have gone weeks with no problems with no product used and then have found bears tipping our garbage cans (they have to go out the night before pickup giving bears, etc. a night to find them - we actually spray a liquid repellant on the cans), deer munching on our newly planted trees and so on.<br /><br />2:  It does not work on for dogs.  We have FIVE dogs and to be honest they do not bother our planting areas of which we have nine.  The day after I put this on three planting areas all three boy dogs (two Shelties and one Golden) went around and marked the area as if it were a challenge to beat out the smell of the Ridder, our female Golden stuck her head into the plants like she was searching for the Holy Grail.  Our female Sheltie did ignore it.  So for dogs it did have an 80% failure rate.\n",

      "I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!\n",

      "For the most part, I was impressed with the design elements that went into the steamer/strainer/etc. components and the meal was much tastier than my standard microwave speed lunch choices.<br /><br />I only had a few minor issues with the product over all... the directions are spread out in several different locations on the package, so there remains a chance that you might miss one and prepare the meal (most importantly to remove the plastic film on the strainer lid before cooking).<br /><br />Also, the water fill line is not all that easy to make out. Most products have a more obvious version and I found myself having to take extra care in adding water.<br /><br />The meat sauce took a bit longer than suggested to cook. I had to up the cook time to a full minute to get a satisfactory temperature.<br /><br />My final criticism concerns the heat of the container after cooking. Granted, you get a little rest for that to cool down while you cook the sauce, but it was still uncomfortably warm when I ported the two (with the sauce atop the strainer lid and lower/main dish in my hand).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the product, despite my small nitpicks and, barring a prohibative price point, would definitely purchase mixers for my on the go working lunches (of which, I seem to have plenty).\n",

      "I've used this product, and others from Premier, for years.  For most dogs it's GREAT (I've fostered dogs and have my own).  I have both the small and medium sizes, which actually both work well for my 50 pound dog but I change them based on the size of kibble I feed.<br /><br />I like that they changed from the plastic-type \"rope\" which could easily be chewed and swallowed, but I don't like the new cotton rope - it's simply too difficult to clean and doesn't dry quickly enough.  I cut it off, purchased a piece of non-toxic acrylic rope, and have been satisfied (just have to tie the ends and burn them so they don't unravel).<br /><br />Kind of a pain to have to get a different rope and wish they would change it, but the replacement only cost me 50 cents.  The jug itself is more durable in the medium size than small, but I use it in a crate that has thick soft bedding now and has lasted almost a year so far.  When my dogs used it on hard floors the bottom of it cracked, although that was after 5 months.<br /><br />There were a couple very powerful chewers that managed to break the tops of these easily (I prefer the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M\">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLWJ1G\">Premier Busy Buddy Linkables Dog Toys Value Pack</a> for them).  However in general they've worked out great and my dogs love them.  You can try making it more challenging by adding a rubber ball inside or pieces of carrots.\n",

      "After finding out what horrors I'd been perpetrating on my kitties with their expensive \"premium\" pet food, I set out to find something that wasn't full of by-products and unnecessary corn ingredients. Halo Spot's Spew definitely fit that bill and their ingredients are probably the best you will find in a cat food. My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.<br />Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources. There are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of Spot's Stew, around 30%, is also a little lower than what I'd like.<br />Overall, however, this is definitely a great food to feed your pets, though if you have a cat that's a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food, Halo Spot's Stew may not be for you.\n",

      "Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore.  We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation.  She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered.  D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation.  She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.<br /><br />It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.  I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call.<br /><br />Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.  The one positive from this awful experience with E-Pets Galore, is that some Animals in need will have some treats that otherwise they would not have had.<br /><br />I am very sad that this experience has turned out this way,<br />Fran B.\n",

I might eat them again for a sweet tooth fix but at $1+ per pack and non-filling I'll probably stick to cliff bars and just secretly raid my office neighbor's starburst jar for a sweet tooth fix here and there.

Buy it where ever you can get it, Peet's are almost everywhere now (and Safeway sells it too, sometimes for less than eight dollars for a 12oz bag!)<br /><br />YUMMY\n",

      "Some people will extol this product, some will dislike it, while others will see some good and some bad points in it. The good are the healthy ingredients: the 5g fiber, 750mg Omega 3, and the five 100% whole grains. Nutritionists have said that if a product states that it is whole grain, it is not 100% unless it explicitly says so. Other people may dwell on what they consider bad points. The problem with 100% whole grains is that many individuals find them tasting too grainy. This is the case here. It is one of the reasons why some manufacturers do not use 100% whole grains. Secondly, the clusters remain hard even after sitting in milk or soy for several minutes. This may be too hard for some consumers. Thirdly, the cereal is filled with flax seeds, which is good, but they do not soften, and they get caught in some people's teeth.\n",

I didn't find it too salty (and I'm usually pretty sensitive to salt), and the flavor was nice -- spicy withou being too hot.<br /><br />I made it with boneless skinless chicken thighs, and added a sweet Walla Walla onion along with the chicken, served over saffron rice.<br /><br />Butter Chicken from KOI is still my favorite, but this is a close second.\n",

Smooth, mellow and and no hateful after taste.  Doesnt taste like decaf either.  If you want it a little stronger make a smaller cup size. I was pleasantly surprised how smooth and perfectly blended it tasted.  Go easy on the cream and sugar.  i drink it black, but if you go easy on the cream and sugar, like my wife, she enjoyed it also.  So, sit back in the evening and enjoy a great cup of joe without the caffiene or the bitter flavor.\n",

But given the composition, (a bag of 60 or 70 pieces weighs one ounce) its really a treat, not suited as a regular meal.<br /><br />**** the salmon product is great!!!  The chicken product is totally ignored by my cat(s).  Mine and cats owned by friends.  So if you are new to this, start with the salmon.<br /><br />Also, in my most recent order, something changed.  I ordered 6 boxes, 5 contained the usual tin foil, inner bag.  This is a bag inside the box shown above.  The 6th box, however, had a clear plastic inner bag, and for some reason, my cats reaction was more subdued.  She ate them, but not with the usual excitement.  Not sure what to make of this.<br /><br />Its tough to describe a cats excitement.  But if your favorite dessert is tiramisu, imagine the salmon product is tiramisu for cats.\n",

      "I'd been curious about seaweed snacks for quite some time.  After trying a pack of Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, I have to say I am a fan.  The snacks are perfect as just that -- a snack.  They have 60 calories per container so you don't have to feel bad about eating one or two containers.<br /><br />The seaweed is thin but has a crispy component.  There is a bit of salt but I wouldn't say that these are anywhere near as salty as a Lay's potato chip.  Initially, the smell of the seaweed seemed very strong.  I don't eat fish but that was all I could think of when eating the first few pieces.  After a while, I didn't notice the scent so much.<br /><br />There are two things that I don't like about this product.  The first is the amount of packaging.  The second is the use of canola oil.  To deal with both, I've started to make my own snacks.  I use nori and apply coconut oil or sesame oil and salt and place it in the oven for a bit.  For those that think these are too salty, the make your own method allows you to control the amount of oil and salt.<br /><br />Made in Korea.<br /><br />If interested in trying a single package of Annie Chun's and your grocery store does not carry the product, try iherb.com. If interested in iherb, you can use code LEK375 for a discount.\n",

I'm canceling my subscription and looking for another brand.  It's very good, but not good enough to justify the price difference.<br /><br />Edit:  Since posting this review I discovered that the price of coffee beans has doubled due to weather and bad crops.  How bad is it?  Apparently opium farmers are tearing out their crops and planting coffee beans.  So, Camano Island jacking up the price is understandable and should be expected (although some notice to subscribers would be nice).

In fact, the Crystal Light margarita mix really doesn't taste like a margarita at all to me.  I was able to mix it half and half with one of the premixed mixers and the flavor was close enough, so I guess you might be able to spend a little less on your margaritas by extending your mixers with the Crystal Light, if you're on a really super tight budget.  Otherwise, I would buy it only as a refreshing alternative to the other standard Crystal Light flavors. The flavor is not tart like lemonade..just kind of smooth and refreshing.

However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.

Most of the time I wear my hair back so that it's important that I'm not flaking all over my clothes.<br /><br />This stuff is thick.  Be careful when you squeeze it out of the tube because it has the consistency of yogurt.  That does make it a little difficult to spread around, so you need to rub it in your hands first then put it on strategic spots and then rub it into your hair.  A little extra water when your rubbing your hair (especially if its long) will help.  If not just use it on the crown of your head and a conditioning shampoo after.  It does have its' own conditioner so you can just was it out and leave your hair easy to comb.<br /><br />I didn't do anything unusual like washing my hair twice, and when I finished not only was my hair clean and tangle free but the skin under my beard was totally free of dry skin.  I even used some on the prickly-heat on my chest and the skin there looked like I had used and exfoliate (yes I know this stuff has a lot of the same ingredients).<br /><br />So more like 4.5 stars for me, great product.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz\n",

      "I was just two pounds shy of my Weight Watchers goal when I fell off the weight loss wagon and gained four additional pounds.  Life was busy, and I wanted a fuss-free way to lose those last pounds before swimsuit season.  Since I enjoy Special K products, I thought I'd put the Special K 2-Week Weight Loss Challenge to the test.  I ate Special K cereal for two meals, snacked on fruits and veggies (instead of the recommend Special K snack products) and made healthy dinner choices.  I didn't expect to lose 6 pounds as advertised, since my weight loss had slowed from months of dieting and I was near my goal weight.  To my surprise, I lost 6 pounds and have finally reached my goal weight!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DIET:<br /><br />It's convenient and doesn't require much planning.  However, it could get a little boring in the long run.  It could also be difficult to meet daily nutritional requirements.  Also, rapid weight loss could be difficult to maintain in the long run.  If you've been dieting and just can't lose those last few pounds, or if you need to lose a few pounds fast for a big event, give Special K a try.<br /><br />ABOUT THE CEREAL:<br /><br />One can usually find a box of Special K in my kitchen cabinet.  Most often, it is the Red Berries variety.  I enjoy the Fruit and Yogurt flavor, as well, but the serving size is 1/4 cup less.  The original flavor is also nice from time to time, but the Chocolatey Delight is just not a good idea, in my opinion.  But back to the Red Berries.  The cereal consists of the usual Special K flakes with dehydrated strawberries.  Once I pour on my Silk Light soy milk, the berries plump up to add lots of real strawberry flavor.  There are generous amounts of berries and the flakes stay crispy in milk.  All in all, this is an excellent cereal that I highly recommend.\n",

      "We just moved to Virginia from Washington state, so many more bugs and with 4 boys I thought this would be a great intriguing first house plant! It arrived in great health and came with clear detailed instructions. My 7 year old helped read directions and we choose a fun hand painted ceramic coffee mug that my boys had previously decorated for a Mothers day present and successfully planted it. It is now thriving in window and my 7 year old goes outside on a bug hunt to find \"Pavement\" tiny ants to feed it. The ants are so tiny that one dead or maimed is enough to place on plant. At first he put it in flower. Which was soon picked off by my 3 year<br /> old. I was worried that this may harm plant but it appears to still be thriving. I may be wrong but I believe this plant stalk/leaves are able to absorb the nutrients from the bugs? As it appears to be sticky? Not sure as it has only been a week since flower bud was picked off by my son. All in all I found it tobe a fun houseplant to have especially with curious boys and of course the \"Carnivorous\" aspect is most thrilling!\n",

      "I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6\">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E\">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend<br />Tully's French Roast Coffee<br />Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend<br />Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Black Gold Extra Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven:<br /><br />Tully's Full City Roast Coffee<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend<br />Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic Extra Bold<br />Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA\">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my little individual cup packages in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0TZO4\">Sharpie</a>, of course, \"Breakfast\", \"Lunch\" and \"Dinner\". So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors I'm going to wind up with.<br /><br />I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip.<br /><br />I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on caffeine. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.\n",

Just not exciting. Anyway I splurged, I'm an old guy and simply wanted to at least have tried the \"good\" stuff at least once. I typically use the cheese grated or shaved on salads or pasta. I was amazed this stuff is too good to waste on pasta or salads, It needs to be eaten freshly cut from the piece with sliced raw apple or pear. It's to be savored slowly and with concentration. It is simply the best I've ever had, anywhere. I will use it on my salads and pasta but I will never be able to go back to the impersonators. Just for information the seller A. G. Ferrari Foods was perfect also but the cheese overshadows all else.\n",

      "It's hard to review something like a snack bar because a lot of time it comes down to things like personal taste and preferences, but I'll try to do it as much justice as I can<br /><br />The strawberry soy joy bar has a texture that reminds me of a dense version of a nutrigrain bar, minus the filling.  It's full of fruit chunks and has a strong, fruity floral flavor.<br /><br />What I like most about these bars is that their 130 calories make them perfect for a snack, unlike many bars that are higher in calories and fat and more of a meal replacement.  It also has 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein which I consider sufficient for a snack.  They do a relatively good job of tiding me over until the next meal or beating the afternoon munchies.<br /><br />That said, there are some things I do not care for, which are the reason I give them 3 stars.  The first is that visually they seem incredibly tiny for the calorie count, which makes them less satisfying in a way.  I compared them to my typical Luna bar and was surprised to find it was only 50% bigger (weight wise) than the Soy Joy bar.  Visually it looks much bigger but I'm wondering if this has to do with how dense the Soy Joy bar is.  The second is that I didn't really care for the flavor.  It was too sweet compared to things like a Luna, Odwalla, or Lara Bar, but probably on par with something like a Nutrigrain bar.  I also couldn't really tell that the flavor was strawberry.  It mostly just tasted sugary.  There were also a lot of ingredients in the bar that I couldn't taste at all.  The label mentions chocolate chips and pineapple but I couldn't taste these at all, just a generic kind of sweetness.<br /><br />Another thing worth noting is that it is not enriched with any vitamins like a lot of meal and snack bars.  This isn't a concern to me since I attempt to eat a varied and balanced diet, but does make this bar different than something like a Luna Bar that is typically enriched with a lot of vitamins and minerals.  Overall this just wasn't a bar I cared for very much.  It seemed so small for the number of calories and just tasted generically sweet and dense.<br /><br />The bottom line is that taste is subjective and you may like these bars even if I do not.  However, in my opinion I find the flavors of bars like Luna and Odwalla to be closer to what the description says and more satisfying overall.  However if you don't care for those bars and are looking for something different this may be closer to what you are looking for.\n",

      "As stated, reasonably good for instant coffee. I think most everyone would prefer a cup of fresh-brewed, but that's not always feasible. I brew fresh Newman's Organics in the AM, but in the afternoon when I just want that one cup or when we're traveling, this far surpasses the hotel coffee or others available. Although Starbucks abound, they typically do not have the organic varieties \"on tap,\" and that is a requirement for me. These are also great for when you want to make a quick iced coffee-- you don't have to make/plan ahead or use ice because you're trying to cool the coffee down-- just take some cold (organic) milk, few ice cubes, and a packet or two of these (to taste). To the best of my knowledge, this is the only instant organic on the market-- comparing to Starbucks Via isn't really a fair comparison, because it's not organic. I guess your like or dislike of this coffee depends somewhat on what your priorities are. I like it well enough, and am back to buy more.\n",

      "First I must admit that I am not normally an only the very best will do for our pets kind of a person. I tend more towards middle of the road products for our pets, not the cheapest stuff, but I also don't seek out the most expensive. Thanks to Amazon's Vine program I received a bag of these to test out for free in return for writing a review. Judging from the product page, I'm not the only one :).<br /><br />When I read the ingredients list I was tempted to put a few in a pot of water and make stew for the family dinner. Organic barley, lamb and other goodies. Sounds good to me! But, I controlled myself and didn't try a taste.  When I gave one to the dog she absolutely loved it!  But, she loves to eat just about anything.<br /><br />As a matter of personal choice, these premium treats are just a bit of a step to far for me when it comes to pet food. I realize that saying so will probably earn me some \"not helpful\" votes. I can live with that.<br /><br />If you want only the very best products for your dog and your dog likes these, then by all means go for it!

The first time I soaked it for a minute like the directions said and then cooked it.  It tasted like straw!  I felt like throwing the rest of the package in the trash!  But, I decided to give it another try.  I soaked it for about ten minutes and then drained.  I used the recipe on the package called \"Aglio Olio  Style\".  Basically, it's stir fried vegetables.  I used red bell peppers, onions and shrimp.  I added creole seasoning and then the Brown Rice Vermicelli and some olive oil.  Stirred it off and on until the shrimp were cooked.  The vermicelli was very moist and soft.  It was delicious!  It actually came out like angel hair pasta.  I will be buying this again!<br /><br />On a side note, I was a little disappointed to note that the fiber count was not very high.  One of the reasons I like brown rice is for the higher fiber content. The total fat grams are very low.  The sugars are 2.2g and the protein is 3.2 grams.  Total carbohydrates are 47.1 grams.  It is cholesterol and gluten free.\n",

      "I've been using my new Beaba Babycook less than once a day for three months. It started leaking terribly whereby my entire unit would be sitting in a puddle of water after each cooking session -- VERY dangerous given this is an electrical appliance, so I contacted Customer Service. They very correctly told m that if the pitcher leaks, it is because the gasket needs to be replaced. I did exactly as told and it did fix the problem. However, I was concerned that I have used the Beaba less than once a day in the course of two months and the gasket already needed replacing. I was only pureeing poached pears and zucchini after all, nothing hard. Anyway, I raised this concern with Beaba and they basically expect you to buy a new gasket every month to replace the broken one. That's $2+shipping every month ON TOP OF $150 for the basic unit?!?!? That seems a bit ridiculous to me. Very disappointed in the overall design of the Babycook if this is what I am to expect.<br />Out shopping for a different baby food cooker and NOT recommending this one nor buying it for any expectant parents ever again!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have also had problems with the lid not matching up to the pitcher, and the food being pureed always shoots out the back and sides. This happens EVERY time I use it and sometimes, when using more water, it is very dangerous: Today, I scalded my entire forearm because the boiling hot water sprayed out when I was pureeing my steamed veggie. This is a very dangerous (and messy) design flaw and I don't see why for $150, Beaba can't make something where the lid actually covers the cooking unit.\n",

      "*Note: This may seem like a shill review, but I am in no way affiliated with Flint River - I am just one happy customer (well three counting my wife and pup)!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the best dog food on the market. Forget all of these pet store-sold brands that use words like \"plus\", \"pro-formula\" and \"healthy\" - it's marketing hype and is not beneficial for your dog. After talking with Chandler (see first reviewer) my wife and I decided to give Flint River Ranch a go. We had been using <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264TMWU\">Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Small Breed Dogs</a> and we were generally quite pleased. They at least used natural ingredients in beneficial amounts (meat always main ingredient) - but after reading up on the difference in meat quality used, as well as several recalls over the past 3 years, we decided it was time for a change. Chandler's helpful post has already outlined why using human-grade meat is important so I won't go over that, but to highlight one important thing every dog owner should realize: your dog is not a wild wolf! It has been domesticated over generations, changing its genetic makeup; he or she can't handle poor quality meat.<br /><br />Our pup had recently been suffering from allergies - Blue Buffalo helped a little but they were still present. As cute as it is to have our little pup bound up to us with a runny nose every now and then, we knew that she must be uncomfortable! We were going to go with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72\">Newman's Own Dog Food</a> but our dog is a 24lb. whippet mix and an examination of the kibble at a friend's place showed it to be a little too big for her. So, we jumped on Flint River's website and put an order in. We were a little nervous about our picky eater - she has a hard time with  Eukanuba when visiting the in-laws, and even when we tried a different Blue Buffalo food to mix things up she was hardly enthusiastic. Luckily for us, she jumped right on her bowl of Flint River the first time around! The kibble itself is more like broken up dog biscuits:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Human-grade meat is used<br />- No artificial preservatives or fillers<br />- NO ANIMAL BY-PRODUCTS<br />- Food is twice-baked to preserve healthful properties<br />- Nicely sized, even for smaller dogs<br />- Food has never been recalled<br />- Customer Service is excellent<br />- Our dog seemed to love it<br /><br />\"CONS\"<br />- Price<br /><br />I put \"cons\" in parentheses because while you are paying more for your food, you are (a) looking out for your buddy which in my mind is worth it, and (b) you may be saving money of vet visits down the road. Dogs are genetically quite similar to humans. If a person takes care of themselves by eating well and exercising often, doctor's visits are only necessary for injuries and check-ups (at least in my experience). The same goes with dogs and vet visits!<br /><br />Listen, no dog food is going to magically make your dog run like a greyhound and pull people out of burning buildings like Lassie, but smart choices lead to a better life for your pup. Heck, we don't even know how old our dog is (looks like a puppy but has some grey on the muzzle), but we want to invest in her life by making good choices! Nothing irks me more than reviews on pet food that say \"My dog didn't like this food, ONE STAR!\" - your dog can't smell what food is best for them. Give it time, allow them to get used to this food and for their body to reap some of the benefits, and I hope you will find it as worth it as we did! We have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I will updated this review in a couple of months when we really start to see the positive effects!<br /><br />Still not convinced? Flint River offers four sample meals of their food for less than five bucks shipped. Give it a try before you drop the premium price!<br /><br />This food is recommended by my wife and I (and our little girl, Poppy) without reservation - if you can't afford to cook fresh chicken and rice for your dog each day, this is the next best thing! Absolutely worth the price!\n",

      "I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!\n",

      "I bought this tub expecting the nostalgic Dubble Bubble smell and taste I loved as a kid. That gum was packed in the old Fleer Baseball Card wax-packs. Concord Confections bought the rights to the name from Fleer. (Subsequently Tootsie Roll bought Concord.) Anyway, The flavor formula was changed by Concord. It's now just generic bubblegum. Not only that, the size of the gum has been reduced. With clever packaging, it looks about the same size wrapped, but the gum is no longer a solid \"barrel\" shape. It is now a smaller barrel with gear-like teeth around it which holds the packaging out so it seems like a substantial piece than it is. The logo is misleading too. It says, \"America's Original\". Well the name is the same but the product is completely different.\n",

      "Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...\n",

      "We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!\n",

I have had trouble locating it from time to time in the local grocery and Asian food stores so I am happy to see Amazon carrying it. Great for anything you want to add some spicy heat on. My favorite for adding to any Asian or American meat dish, fish, chili, spaghetti, and many other things. If the top of your head isn't sweating a little it just isn't helping your immune system. Just tell any restaurant that you want the hot sauce with the rooster on the bottle with the green top.<br /><br />CA Luster\n",

      "I love coffee, and have a terrible addiction to Starbucks! So, when I was in the coffee aisle looking for a nice flavor to try I saw the Starbucks Caramel Natural Fusions. I was so excited to set up my coffee maker so that all I had to do was hit the switch in the morning! There is nothing I love more than the smell of fresh coffee when a new package is opened but when I opened up this coffee I almost gagged. The smell was overwhelming, sort of like burnt dirt. It was extremely dark in color too, almost like soil. I still have yet to hit the brew button on the coffee maker tomorrow morn, but I figure I would give it a fair shot. After reading some of the reviews here tonight, I am already expecting to be tossing it down the drain.\n",

      "great coffee. having lived in italy for a year, and coming back to new york always buying coffee from eataly is taking a toll on my wallet. the fact that this is so cheap and it's lavazza in the u.s., i love it. even though in italy, they sell a lavazza coffee brick like this in the supermarket for 90cent euro, i'm willing to settle for this as well.<br />only thing is, one of my coffee came in broken :/ but i think it's just by accident that the operations worker slashed it by accident when they are packaging it.<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />update. everything came in perfect condition. was great coffee. i recommend everyone to keep this coffee in a jar, and put it in the fridge! i know it sounds a bit weird, but i swear the coffee will smell so fresh EVERYTIME you open that jar!\n",

After searching the Web for weeks, I finally decided to order three big bags of these seeds.  After the first couple handfuls I began scheming ways to add salt, but I quickly got used to it.  They're texturally the same as salted seeds, the size is good, it just lacks that salty taste.  Time to reorder!\n",

      "Silk chocolate soymilk seems to have a stronger chocolate flavor than other soymilk I've tried. The main competing brand of soymilk for me has lately been a brand called ZenSoy, which, despite being lesser known and having a less appealing package, is actually quite delicious as well.<br /><br />Those who prefer a stronger chocolate flavor would probably prefer Silk. Those who prefer a more \"creamy\" chocolate flavor may find ZenSoy chocolate soymilk more to their liking. Personally, I think they are both great and I'd be happy drinking either.<br /><br />While Silk seems more chocolatey, I'd also say it doesn't seem to taste more sweet. Think dark chocolate vs milk chocolate, perhaps... but the difference is not nearly as noticeable as that. That would be a huge exaggeration. Really though, if you like chocolate milk, either of them would be good choices and I'd encourage trying both of them to see which one you prefer.<br /><br />Soy protein is great too since it's high quality complete protein, similar to what you'd get in meat. It's even better than meat though since it is not accompanied by all the health risks associated with meat or other animal products. It also beats dairy products handily both in terms of not causing diseases like dairy does, and also because unlike dairy protein, soy protein is complete protein.\n",

      "We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision.\n",

It does not live up to the Lavazza name, being more like food-service grade.  It is most certainly not a Premium coffee, as it is called.  It is a light roast, but has an unpleasant, weak taste nevertheless, in addition to poor mouthfeel.  Not worth the money, even when on sale.

      "UPDATE June 2009: They changed the recipe so these are now more tender (good thing), but they got rid of the slight tangy vinegar flavor. Now they don't taste like chicken wings; just spicy chicken jerky. I will probably buy these about once a year now, instead of 1-2 times per month. Back to the Jalapeno jerky, when I can find it!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 11/29/08: I don't eat chicken wings that often any more (90 fat calories per wing, being deep fried and dipped in butter). And I LOVE chicken wings! But if the flavor you crave is that hot sauce & vinegar comingling with a large chunk of tender chicken, then give these a try. If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these! I just wish they weren't so hard to find locally. Circle K and Walgreens are the only retail locations I know of. Eat 1 bag, and you'll be addicted or nonplussed. There's not really a middle road.\n",

      "I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!\n",

      "If you're a fan of the Taco Bell quesadilla and you are looking to capture an authentic Taco Bell flavor in your kitchen this is the sauce for you.  Overall I liked the flavor, but it is almost overwhelmingly salty in isolation.  It makes a great sauce (and has a perfect consistency) for tacos (even fish tacos) and salads.  In other applications such as in quesadillas or burritos (things without a lot of flavorless filler like lettuce to absorb the potency) the ranchero sauce can be somewhat overpowering.  I did have great luck using the sauce add a little punch to fajitas and pan fried vegetables.  In reality, this isn't an all purpose sauce and it's somewhat nuanced as to the types of dishes it works in.<br /><br />I wasn't happy with the nutrition facts, but I found that you don't need near the 2 tablespoons reflected in the serving size (you can get away with 1/4 of that and still get the same flavor).<br /><br />Calories 110<br />Total Fat 11 g<br />Saturated 2 g<br />Polyunsaturated 0 g<br />Monounsaturated 0 g<br />Trans 0 g<br />Cholesterol 10 mg<br />Sodium 310 mg<br />Total Carbs 3 g<br />Dietary Fiber 0 g<br />Sugars 1 g<br />Protein 0 g<br />Potassium 0 mg<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />I went back and forth as to whether to give this product a 3 or 4 star rating, but honestly, I'll buy it in the future and it's one of the better (and less expensive) pre-made sauces on the market today.

      "When I opened my first box of Strawberry Delight Frosted Mini Wheats this morning, I thought I had bought something other than cereal by mistake.  I was expecting something like the usual Frosted mini wheats, with the exception of some pink frosting and perhaps some strawberry flavor.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />Instead, I got a little square of frosting, colored by a pink not found on this Earth and \"scented\" the with the strongest chemical candy perfume that I have ever had the misfortune to come across. It hovered over the box like a pink cloud before taking out a mallet and knocking me into a diabetic coma. There were a few twigs of what was supposed to be cereal, but it was abundantly clear that the frosting is the reason for this stuff, and the twigs are merely a crumb being thrown to caring parents, so they will serve this stuff instead of a nutritious meal. Indeed the only nutritional claim on the box is wrong: the box says that one serving contains 25% of a day's allowance of fiber, when the nutritional information clearly says a serving of this stuff  has only 20% of a day's allowance of fiber. Which one is it?<br /><br />I don't think that the fiber question will matter to the other reviewers,  with most of them eating the confection out of hand as a snack.  Sadly that means they are getting a whole heck of a lot more than the suggested serving of 24 tiny squares of frosting. Happily, that means they'll likely get a whole day's supply of fiber, but they'll also end up with a week's supply of sugar.<br /><br />Once in a while, I have order food from Amazon that does not suit my taste.  This cereal is one of those items.  Usually, I donate the unopened packages to the local food pantry and count it as some good coming from my lesson.  I can't even do that with these this so-called cereal.  In poor homes, the children already consume too many processed foods and simple carbohydrates (sugar, in this case).  I am not going to add to the bad eating habits of the next generation.\n",

She would gobble up an entire pouch every time we offered it to her, and often ask for more.  Unfortunately, Happy Baby had to go and ruin a good thing by reformulating the product!  The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.  I definitely won't be buying this product again, unless Happy Baby goes back to the old formulation.  Grade: D-\n",

      "When my husband first got our cat a few years ago, he started feeding her cheaper cat food.  She threw up one day all over the carpet, and it was really hard to get the \"red\" stains out from the color in the cat food.  He then switched her to Iams, and now on the rare occasion she has those problems, the carpet isn't stained like it was before.  Iams is a little more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth it.  Your cat doesn't cost that much money to keep anyway, so you might as well feed them better quality food.<br /><br />I defintely recommend buying this product from Amazon (the pack of 8 2-lb. bags).  You pay more up front, but it averages out to about the same, or maybe even a little less, as buying the 4 pound bags from the local stores.  Plus, your cat gets \"fresher\" food more often, which is especially good if you only have one cat and don't go through the bag as fast.  Yes, our cat is a little spoiled.\n",

And he doesn't complain about being hungry every hour.  He is happy, content, and satisfied with small portions.  And so are my other two cats.  What a relief.  I also ordered the duck both canned and dry after calling Blue Buffalo to find out the levels of phosphorus and sodium.  They said that the Basic duck and potato, dry, and the Wilderness duck canned are the lowest. I called my vet and he was shocked (in a good way) that they were so low. He said some of the renal diets are higher than Blue Buffalo.  I love this brand.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n",

      "Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count<br /><br />The Marley Coffee comes in single-serving pods, however I did not have a single-serving coffee maker to test these pods. Instead, I tore open the pods and used my Frieling Stainless Steel French press. I let it steep for about 30-40 minutes as I do my morning routine and let the water cool to a drinkable temperature.<br /><br />The coffee is best described as a medium roast. The taste is very mild and actually complements my breakfast very nicely. There is no bitter aftertaste, and it does not smell or taste burnt. I'm not a coffee drinking expert, but I can definitely tell you this coffee tastes great. I usually prefer my local Kona blend or Italian and French roasts for their stronger flavor, but the Marley Coffee is mild but tastes good. I wouldn't say it is coffee flavored water, but it isn't very strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'm not a fan of single-serve pods due to the higher cost. It is a mild tasting coffee, so those that prefer full bodied dark roasts won't like it.\n",

      "The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

I'll be trying other fire and flavor brines for pork also.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(\n",

      "This is what I drink (I usually rotate between Illy, Caribou's Sumatra and Black Cat). I first found it fresh in the Intelligentsia's Chicago Loop shop location, and now always buy it as fresh as I can. When I can, I prefer some of their single plantation beans, but the Intelligentsia Black Cat serves as nice everyday espresso.<br /><br />Sweet, a blend of several beans (Minas Gerais, Brazil and Santa Ana, El Salvador in this case), it finds an excellent balance that successfully avoids the burnt-bitter taste of other espressos.<br /><br />Feel good about it being direct trade, but buy it because of the quality. Help yourself enjoy it by purchasing it with as few middlemen as possible. I often get mine at a local grocer, but it is already a week old.<br /><br />--Brockeim\n",

      "I remember the great tasting maple syrup that I had as a child in Michigan and Canada. I remember going to the farms and sampling the product. As an adult, I have tried to buy high quality syrup from Canada and have been disappointed. Doing a little research, I found that Vermont is where all the unadulterated quality syrup is now sourced.<br /><br />I found grade B to be a little too dark if tasted on its own. It is, however, perfect in its richness, darkness, and maple flavor once it has been drizzled on your food of choice. It is like being a kid again!<br /><br />Packaging: I ordered one jug. It appeared to be pre-packed by the supplier, with the \"ready to ship\" sticker on the box. I imagine they did this due to the leaking others have experienced from time to time. Problem solved! The packaging was wall to wall insulated and the jug itself wrapped with bubble wrap. I can not vouch for other quantities, but a one jug order will be packaged very well.<br /><br />Health: I am a health nut, a trained chef, and a biomedical engineer. Not only is this good quality syrup, but maple syrup has been found recently to have a wide variety of healthy antioxidants. The amount of syrup needed per use is very small, due to the quality and intense flavor. The sugar content is partially and possibly totally made up for by the content of flavanoids usually found in citrus and the catechins found in green tea, tree bark, and chocolate. These help inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates to reduce blood glucose spikes. This is worlds better than drizzling corn syrup on your carbs which would increase the glucose load. I have no problems with eating a little with my oats every morning. Eating healthy does not mean not enjoying your food!\n",

It does taste good, but for some reason it just doesn't have quite the complex, pleasing flavours of the bags.  Perhaps it it just too 'big', and the small tins preserve the spectrum of taste within the tea.  The mint is dulled and so is the rose ... not quite as good as the bags.

      "I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.  I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.  I have a local store that sells items at a good price.  18 bags were $2.69, so I have no reason to buy it in bulk online.  I think I'd save 8 cents on a 3 month supply, then there's shipping.\n",

      "UPDATE: No word on the kibble size, however the 16 lb. size lasted about 6 - 7 weeks for my Westie. Then the remaining 1/4 bag turned moldy. If you have a small dog, stay with the 8 lb. bag!<br /><br />My 11 yr. old Westie loves this food. His breed suffers from skin issues. We see improvement with his skin, he's more lively - and he's definitely more enthusiastic about eating!<br /><br />I bought the 8 lb. bag to try it. This time I bought the 16 lb. bag. There's a big difference in the kibble size with the 16 lb. being not quite double - but significantly bigger. Westies are not big dogs. He's doing okay with it. I've contacted Laughing Dog to see if that's normal. I didn't see a difference in the product description or on the bag - unless I'm missing something.<br /><br />Anyway - great product!

      "In the spring and summer this grass grows with no problem and no sun. It is an absolute miracle to watch. I plant this grass in a plastic planter box and water it just a bit to get the grass started. After a few days it sprouts and then within a few more days it grows three or more inches. Eventually it grows to about six inches and then starts to wilt. Of course by then the cats have had a feeding frenzy and the grass is all torn up and ready to be pulled up. One bag of seeds lasts me through the summer and I plant new seeds about every two to three weeks. So far I've never had problems with this company's seeds but if you are nervous buy some first from a pet store. One thing I do that might be the reason I have success with these seeds is I spread them out on the soil and then barely cover them with a thin layer of soil. I also water them about twice before they sprout. I just think it is amazing that this grass grows without any direct sunlight. My cats adore this grass and I'm sure your cats will too.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. I moved to a place with full sun on a patio and this grass grew much differently with sun. I almost think it grows<br />better in a shaded area.\n",

The only issue I have with it is that this is extremely hard to break in smaller pieces, and if the pieces are too small for the dog, it can be dangerous for the dod, that is the only reason I won't get any more until she is an adult.

It's embarrasing.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, sweet and tangy. It's better than any other hot cider drink I've tasted and the best part is, it's sugar-free and only 10 calories. As a treat, I like to top with fat free whipped cream -- it seems like SUCH an indulgence, but it's very low in calories!<br /><br />As someone who is always watching watch I eat, I do not like to \"drink\" my calories if I can help it -- which is why I shy away from the other hot cider/hot chocolate/teas for my Keurig. Most clock in at around 60-80 calories, so I only have one every few days or so. I can't drink one after another...like I do with these. See? I told you I was obsessed!<br /><br />All that said, I am someone who is USED to eating/drinking artificially flavored/sugar free drinks. I'm a diet soda/Crystal Lite drinker, so the taste isn't anything \"new\" to me -- in fact, I don't quite understand what all the complaining is about these k-cups on here is all about.<br /><br />You can't beat the price -- I'm on the subscribe 'n save plan but I am already ordering more frequently than that because I drink these k-cups like a fish!\n",

There may have been an after taste of fruit punch, but if there was, I really couldn't taste it.<br /><br />The ad said that it has energy in it. Just like the vitamins, I didn't feel any different or energized after I drank the mix. I did get a major headache, which is from the sucralose.<br /><br />I would never buy this product.

      "Bellino Savoiardi Lady Fingers are the best!!!  They are not the spongy American style fingers you get in the store. However, they are NOT the large, fat, lady fingers I was expecting. I was making Tirimisu and wanted something better than was available; in fact the recipe suggested Savoiardi. I saw the advertisement and ordered a box. What I didn't understand was that I was getting a BIG box and will have enough lady fingers to make several 9x13 pans of dessert, which my body can not afford.  The \"fingers\" are excellent and I would highly recommend them. A 9x13 inch dish will hold about 18 fingers per layer and obviously, two layers would use 36 fingers, so you can add that into your planning when you order.\n",

Lose the color!<br />3. Not refreshing at all.<br />4. The zippy top on this package is a bit of a PITA.<br /><br />I would like to try the plain one before writing this product off entirely.

      "I'm normally rather \"meh\" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.\n",

      "Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.\n",

      "R. Adams said \"The weight of the container is stated to be 10 ounces. It's not! The turmeric powder arrived in 8 ounce jars.\"<br />R. Adams has confused liquid ounces with dry ounces.  A liquid ounce is a measure of volume whereas a dry ounce is a measure of weight.  Thus an 8 ounce jar, which holds 8 liquid ounces, could hold a variety of materials, each with a different weight, depending upon the density of the material in the jar.  Therefore the only way to tell if there is 10 ounces of powder in the jar would be to weigh the powder.  Imagine if you will that an 8 ounce jar could be filled up with rocks or marshmallows. You would not expect these 2 jars to weigh the same.<br />I'm giving this product 5 stars just to counterbalance R. Adams's unfortunate error.\n",

      "My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as \"illegal\" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that \"coca leaf\" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  [...]<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com.\n",

ABSOLUTELY, yes.<br /><br />As new cat owners, my husband and I wanted to make sure our two newly adopted cats would get the best care possible. After spending hours researching pet foods on the internet, I was completely shocked (and disgusted!) to find out how terrible the cheap grocery store brands of food really are. It didn't take long for us to settle on Wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation.<br /><br />Thankfully, our cats LOVE this food. They're happy, and we're happy because it's so good for them! We gladly spend the extra money to ensure the health and well being of our two furry children. They love the turkey, chicken, and turkey/salmon varieties, which are all grain free. Turkey is their favorite, which is why I'm posting the review here. :)<br /><br />If you want your cats to eat great food, try Wellness. We are SO glad we did!\n",

      "I'm crazy for Thai Iced Tea, somehow my boyfriend's affinity for Malaysian food has let me this amazing drink, now I can make it at home, my joy is hard to describe. This tastes just like the tea I used to order, the sweet, date like taste of milky, caramel-y creaminess is best drank cold, this mix is insanely easy to use and believe me, tastes like the real thing. There's something alluring to this slightly harvest-spice like drink that is creamy and cool at the same time, it's like visiting India and Antarctica at the same time. It might sound strange but I promise it's easy to drink, in fact too easy, I can drink it all day.<br /><br />The tea comes in a large bag, looks just like the one pictured, inside is the loose twig like tea with small dried leaves with lemongrass pieces and spices. I heat it up in a stainless steel pot on the stove, one cup of cold water per one heaping teaspoon of tea. Boil 5 minutes, then strain through a paper towel lined mesh sieve, then cool it in the fridge. Once cold, it should be sweetened, I add simple syrup since it dissolves faster than sugar ( boil equal amounts of sugar and water, then cool and use to sweeten anything) and mix well, then pour over ice and top with evaporated milk. I drink it though a straw, and even add bubbles ( tapioca pearls) for a bubble tea like drink. This is sooo tasty and really easy to make in large amounts that I see myself making one now, good thing I have a batch chilling in the fridge as I type.<br /><br />Great and refreshing drink that is simply addictive, but still good for you, hurray!<br />- Kasia S.\n",

      "OMG. I am SO relieved. I've just taken my first few sips and I HAD to come and post a review. I've had this tea sitting around for weeks, frankly out of fear of it's taste. I read the reviews here and in other places. Descriptions like \"earthy\" and \"mushroom\" had me gagging at the thought of drinking the tea. I do NOT like mushrooms and \"earthy\" is a very vague description.<br /><br />That being said (this review is strictly about the taste. I will post later if I truly notice any health benefits) there is a subtle taste it that can only be described as earthy. Probably the way you'd imagine tree bark to taste. Not horrible, but nothing to drool about. I don't taste mushroom at all. The flavor is SUPER mild. It's not strong so it's almost pleasant to drink. Although the tree bark doesn't make my taste buds do a happy dance, I'm not gagging. I didn't need to add sweetener to my tea, and I can drink this every morning from now on with no problem. I have been trying to wean myself from coffee to tea and this is a good compromise IF it can wake me up in the mornings. The earthiness of the tea almost gives the satisfaction of drinking a cup of coffee that's not quite sweet enough. If you don't like sweetener in your coffee, you will probably enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I didn't time the brew. I have one of those 16 oz insulated cups with the tea diffuser inside. I filled the diffuser (not sure if it holds 1 oz. or 2) and I put hot water in the cup. I gave it 2-3 minutes then poured out the (light reddish) water and put in new water. It immediately became dark red. About 3-5 minutes later, I threw away the tea leaves.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I made mine too weak since I used a big cup. Maybe I should let it steep for 6-10 minutes? Also, I have to check to see if I used enough...or even too much tea. I'll play with it to make sure I'm getting the maximum health benefit but for now, don't be afraid to taste it! It's not horrible. No lingering after taste. If you don't like it, you'll forget it within 30 seconds of having tasted it.<br /><br />Go ahead, take the chance.\n",

Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.

      "I saw the Quaker Real Medleys at my grocery store for about 2.50 a container.  I loved the thought of pistachio and cherry in an oatmeal.  When I made the product, I found it to be robust on sweetness, skimpy on cherries, and fairly generous with the almonds.  The overall sensation was that this product was really nothing to cry home about.  The flavor was fine but the brown sugar and sweetened cherries yield something that is a bit too sweet for me to turn to again as a breakfast option, especially at the current price point.  I hated that the manufacturer used a plastic 7 container.  Plastic 7 containers - unlike plastic 1 and plastic 2 - are not easily recycled.  I'll stick with Dr. McDougall oatmeal (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFRU3U\">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Peach, Raspberry, Oatmeal & Barley, 3-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTM8\">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Cranberry Oatmeal, 3.1-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />Note: This product has milk derivatives and is therefore not vegan.\n",

It was smooth (no tart overpowering coffee taste) and did not leave an aftertaste as some powdered hot drinks do.  I did find that as a dedicated chocoholic that I had to put in more than the recommended amount in order to get the flavor that was satisfying to me.  When it is made with milk it becomes a rich drinking experience.  When it is made with water the flavor is much more light.

      "I first stumbled onto Land O'Lakes Cocoa Variety Packs at my local branch of a national warehouse store. As some other reviewers have noted, in retail stores this product is treated as a seasonal item, so by the time the winter holidays have passed, you may not be able to just run out and purchase it. It's a pity that it sells for so much more online because it is a really delicious hot cocoa.<br /><br />All the included varieties are made with real powdered milk, which makes such a difference in your final cup. There aren't many instant cocoas that can compete with homemade, but this is one that might. The varieties included in your pack do seem somewhat inconsistent, since different sellers claim the same \"7 Variety Pack\" but have different pictures and item descriptions. The sampler I had contained Supreme, Arctic White, White Chocolate with Peppermint, Caramel, Raspberry, Dark Chocolate and Vanilla. The other flavors that appear (either in product descriptions or photos) are Tiramisu, Graham, Cinnamon and Mint. Generally speaking, all of the mixes are quite good. I found the Dark to be a bit too dark for my tastes, and the Arctic White a bit too sweet; I solved the problem by mixing the two powders together, half a packet of each per cup, and loved the result.<br /><br />Another nice thing about these Land O'Lakes Cocoa Packs is that the individual pouches are all tin, not just paper, so they stay fresh a long time. In my house, they didn't last a terribly long time regardless, but the last cups were just as creamy and warming as the first ones. I highly recommend trying out the Variety Packs. They're perfect for large gatherings (just add hot water!) and there really aren't any bad flavors.\n",

      "They were passing out samples of these the other day and so I took one and brought it home to try.<br /><br />It looks like a bar cookie, browned on one side, and smells sweet and fruity.  It tastes a little bit like a cross between a cookie and bread pudding with coconut flavor while the papaya, mango and pineapple combine to taste just about like dried apricot to me.  The flavor combination is not bad at all.  I wouldn't guess that it had soy in it instead of another type of flour and the texture isn't bad, just the right amount of chewiness.<br /><br />However, the bar is fairly small and a little dry so I probably won't be buying any.  People who like this sort of snack or have some special reason to choose them like avoiding wheat products will probably enjoy them. If I were offered other flavors to try I would taste them so my rating is neutral.\n",

I LOVE butter chicken at Indian restaurants, but I found that if you followed the instructions exactly on this packet, it doesn't taste anything like what I get in the restaurants (please no arguments about \"authenticity\").  What I did this last time was add MORE butter (around 5 tablespoons...closer to 6), add about 1/4 cup of 2% milk instead of 1 cup of water, about 3 tablespoons of honey, salt to taste (I usually hate adding additional salt when using spice mixes) and coconut milk instead of heavy cream at the end.  I have not tried any other butter chicken spice mixes, but I do like the Kitchens of India one for its nice spice kick.  Not too spicy hot, but enough for you to notice and enjoy while tasting all the other flavors.  It's definitely cheaper than going out, and it's nice to know that I can get close to what I get in the restaurants whenever I get a butter chicken craving.\n",

And making a fantastic, delicious sauce only takes minutes and a few ingredients. On the jar it gives a very simple recipe for making your own pasta sauce--just add garlic, salt and basil. Of course you can add as many things as you like, but we like simpler tasting pasta sauce. If you can get these in a store near you, I highly recommend it. Do NOT buy from here! I can get them at my grocery store for 2.89 per jar. So it is a complete rip off that they are selling these for over $6 a jar!!

The directions were specific about heating this product and I followed them to a \"T\".  Heating 30 seconds at a time in the microwave at a lower power (4-5) and stir after each heat time.  It seems that it might take forever but be patient, it is heating within.  This was a wonderful treat and it tasted wonderful even after all that time of sitting in the cupboard.

      "I have severe diet restrictions.  All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.

While puppy-sitting, I also gave the same treat to my Mom's dog and my brother's dog.  They both went nuts for the treat too.  I'll admit that's not exactly a discriminating audience (they aren't finicky dogs) but it seems to be quite popular.\n",

I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors.

      "This is a berry flavored beverage that actually tastes like a berry drink. Most of the energy drinks have a chemically after taste and the flavors are weak and don't mask it well. The new taste that the advertisements are talking about is backed up by reality in this case. I shared it (it is a big can) with some of my friends who drink a lot of energy drinks including Monster and No Fear and they were also surprised by the flavor. Good news: the can shows only 1 carb per serving and lists no sugars. Not sure about that, but it's better than some competitors that have the equivalent of a dozen donuts worth of sugar!<br /><br />A huge down side is that a can of this has about 260 calories, which makes it one of the higher calorie energy drinks out there.<br /><br />Also, the caffeine in this drink is appx 87 mg per serving (2x each can) which is lower than some of the other energy drinks. So if you are going for caffeine for energy this one wont work. Admittedly, they are going for supplement energy from Creatine, Guarana, L-Carnitine and Taurine and you really ought to know what works for you before you start buying cases of this stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a much better flavor which will likely become a favorite for energy drinkers.\n",

Its great on baked potatoes with a dollop of butter... remembering that in the Downunder way you use only a small amount of it as its very strong.<br /> I recall as a kid having it on sandwiches, cheese and vegemite, cheese, lettuce and vegemite. Vegemite and chopped walnuts on bread. Grilled cheese and vegemite, on and on it is so multi useful. Dry toast it on bread sticks for teething babies...<br /><br /> I am nearly out of my current vegemite, having shared it to some adventuring Americans here a work, for the record I got no converts but one of the Dr's assured me I would find it on Amazon so here I am looking and yayyyy i don't have to be deprived.<br /><br /> I read another review and here is my absolute favourite way to have vegemite.. thick slice of fresh bread, thick load of butter and a small portion of vegemite.. scrape on and scrape off..

      "This bread has been a staple in our household for the last 3 years.  After my wife and oldest daughter were diagnosed with Celiac Disease, we went on the hunt for good bread.  It certainly took a while with some barely edible \"bread\" along the way.  Now I make a loaf of GF Pantry bread almost every weekend and watch it go.  I have a hard time leaving it for them.  I typically add 1tsp of Potato Flour (not starch) to keep it from getting crumbly.  I also add a couple of Tbsp of ground Flax Seed for some whole grain.  I let it rise for about an hour in a warm place or oven. For sandwiches, French Toast, grilled cheese, even hamburger buns, we have yet to find a better alternative.

      "I started using Wellness Core Ocean about 3 months ago. I have English Bulldogs, and work very hard to make sure they eat the best food available. Even though a number of my co-workers at a veterinary hospital were skeptical, I was told to report back and let my colleagues know of my results. I am very impressed with this food. My dogs who are confined in the house for most of our brutal Arizona summers are heavy all summer long... not this year. Their coats are spectacular, no swollen tail folds and face wrinkles... shedding is down to a minimum. I have not bought the food from Amazon, but I will try it next month... at this price, why not?<br />  As for the recall, it has nothing to do with diamond foods, Core is separate. The only food effected by the recall will never be made with that partnership again. It's best not to get hysterical about something that simply is not going to effect you. Some people love to frighten others.<br />  In my almost 30 years of looking at skin and coats, I've never seen results like this. I can buy a large selection of foods at a deep discount, a perk at our veterinary hospital, but will not choose that road.<br />I will report back on my shipment quality when I get it.<br />Andrea\n",

      "****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me; it is important though if you are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****\n",

The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy!

      "I love this drink, I truly do.  It is the first pick-me-up drink I have found that works for me.  I react strongly to large amounts of caffeine (it makes me incredibly hyper) and I never developed a taste for coffee, so my choices for something to keep my brain running when I'm worn out are limited.  Add to that the fact that I'm not a big soda drinker and the choices are even fewer.  Neuro Sonic is a great blend for me.  There's some caffeine in it, but not as much as other products, so it makes me a bit quicker on the draw without making me babble like an idiot like I do when I have too much caffeine.  It's carbonated, which I don't care for, but *lightly* carbonated, so it's not unbearable for me.  The flavor is pleasant and light, not at all overpowering.  The packaging is unusual, so it stands out in the refrigerator at work and I never have to wonder which drink is mine.  The one major con to this product is the price.  As the other reviewers have stated, it is very expensive.  I would probably drink one of these a day if it weren't so expensive.  As it is priced currently, I don't even drink one a week.  I save them for when I really, really need a boost.  So, yes, as another reviewer said, this company could really learn something about the merits of selling product based on quantity.  I would be happy to purchase it more often, if the price were to come down to something more reasonable.  That said, I do still buy it and I do still believe in the product.  The price just dictates that I consider it an indulgence instead of a necessity.\n",

Let me first say that 9 pounds of sour worms is a lot! These worms are very good. They are pretty big and the sour taste is not over powering. The fruit flavors are all tasty but there are only 3 different flavor combnations and after a half a bag I got kind of tired of the flavors and they weren't as enjoyable. If you don't eat them too fast like I did though they are very good. If I could do it again I would buy a 4.5 pound bag of this and 4.5 bag of something else for more of a variety.

It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18. It's lovely. Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco. There's some leather and cream too. First sip opens bright with honeyed corn. Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect. Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke. It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best. The absence of \"corn likker\" fruitiness is most appreciated. This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.\n",

While we would like to have the ability of getting a larger size bag, say 24-32 ounces, it was nice to be able to get the 9 ounce bag of chips. The price was very good and the free shipping was great!\n",

      "These French heirloom beans are wonderful.  They are reminiscent of a white bean without the grainy-texture of a navy bean.  There's a recipe on the back of the bag about how to make a lovely French stew with said beans, and it was very tasty. (The stew is slightly creamy with tomatoes and savory spices. Delicious.)  The best thing about them: they are soak-free!!!  Most beans require an overnight soaking time, but these are similar to lentils and peas in that they do not need to be soaked and actually shouldn't be soaked in advance.<br /><br />Take a chance...heirloom beans are delightful!\n",

      "Okay, it's kashi, it's healthy, it's full of real food, in as much, these are more substantial (read thick and grainy) than a regular cookie...these are not going to taste like standard oatmeal raisin cookies...the cookies are rather dry (and i do have some concerns about the little packs in the boxes that keep the cookies ...umm fresh) I'm not sure how safe/healthy those are but i'm not a scientist so i'll leave it at that (I guess they are moisture control) anyhow, all in all these cookies are good for someone who want's a cookie but without the guilt factor. These are one at a time sized cookies, and I actually can't imagine wanting to eat more than one at a sitting anyhow because they are kind of hard to work through (See grainy/dry) but the flavor overall is good, I prefer this better than the dark chocolate or trail mix, I think the raisins add just a bit of moisture so this variety is a touch less dry, and also a tiny bit sweeter. Also, something to note, if you are buying kashi items in bulk be prepared to eat a lot of them and quickly as the expiration dates are usually no more than 2 or 3 months past purchse (afterall these don't have all the chemicals/preservatives of your typical quick foods. That being said, all in all, this is my favorite of the three kashi cookie varieties,and they are a healthy option for cookie lovers.\n",

I've been \"jonesin\" for some licorice whips for many months, but couldn't find them anywhere in a 60 mile radius. I couldn't believe it!! Where in the hell were they hiding them?  So, while ordering some stuff on Amazon, I stumbled onto a candy ad, which led me to the licorice. I saw the \"whips,\" read the info on them, the one review and the rest is history. My first bite is a memorable one. The taste was so fresh, moist, very strawberry flavor and snapped so cleanly away from my month. Like a light snap of your finger. I will buy from this company again and probably in a larger quantity!! Thanks Amazon and Sweet Gourmet.\n",

I see a lot of negative reviews about this product from people who claim to have followed the directions of just went ahead and immediately put the packet in a planter.  Peppers can be tricky to grow and with this particular setup (I've purchased the various other 'magic' plant's over the years and never had a bad one) you have to understand that these are NOT native to the america's so the growing conditions need to be taken into consideration.  It says on the package itself to rest the item in 50% sunlight (meaning to put it on a windowsill where you don't get much direct sunlight through.  My bedroom only receives direct light until about 10:00a.m.) and then when the plant has grown large enough to transfer it into direct sunlight.  My particular pack had 4 sprouts come out (higher than normal) and I transplanted them early and lost two of them to the sun.  The other two are growing fine in a planter where I eagerly await my ghost chili's to improve my hot sauce recipes.  If you REALLY follow the directions and know just a little about gardening this WILL grow for you.  If you look for the seeds you will not find them as pepper seeds can be VERY small and blend in well with planting material.\n",

But this 'Jalapeno' Sauce doesn't even meet that criteria.<br /><br />First of all: \"Bold & Creamy\"?  I guess it's creamy, in a gag-inducing way, but there is no bold there.  Perhaps someone passed a jalapeno over the bottle as a flavoring. Maybe.  There is no heat, no kick at all.  Which would be fine; some people don't like kick.  Except they named it Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce.  So....yeah.<br /><br />Even if you accept that this is a mild sauce, it's still gross.  There is buttermilk in it, which gives it a tang, but soybean oil & water are the first two ingredients (of more than 25).  The whole thing just tastes really chemical-y and fake and bad.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I have teenage boys.  Who run cross country.

      "Despite still not being convinced of the safety of any artificial sweeteners and finding the price somewhat inexplicably high, I've been a years-long devotee of the various Crystal Light Lemonades due to the low cal factor and the fact that I don't like carbonated beverages.<br /><br />I love the Pink Lemonade flavor, though it seemed to disappear for a while and still is scarce. I also like the regular and Raspberry Lemonades, though the Raspberry seems to have changed formula for the worse over the past year or so. I do doctor these two flavors by either mixing them in equal parts and/or adding a splash of tangerine juice or some berry juice to the plain lemonade or a fresh-squeezed lemon (bottled lemon juice in a pinch) to either to perk them up and made them less fake tasting.<br /><br />So, looking for some additional variety, and going by the unanimous high praise in the reviews, I thought I'd give the Pomegranate flavor a try. Wow--bad decision! First off, I don't know where the Lemonade part comes in, as I don't taste a bit of it. I even tried my trick of mixing it 1 to 1 with the plain Lemonade mix, but to no avail. The phony \"pomegranate\" flavors, along with enough pigment to dye a blanket scarlet, and a distinct bitter artificial sweetener after-taste refuse to be concealed.<br /><br />I even thought I'd salvage my financial output by using these over time by adding just a but to my other Crystal Light concoctions, but this stuff, even in the tiniest measure, overpowers the everything. And, since each unit comes in a 5000 year thick plastic container, I can't even just toss them, but must add them to my giant pile of them filling up my garage, as I'm sure I can eventually find a use for them. (They're great for small items--if you're a crafter or a carpenter you'd probably be happy to use them to store beads, nails, screws, etc., but even you will end up with a huge stockpile unless you don't mind clogging the landfills.)<br /><br />I also don't care for the new packets Crystal Light is using inside the plastic tubs, but I've already complained about that in one or two other reviews or comments...\n",

However at this point, after too many bags of expensive specialty food, it seems clear that this is a behavioral problem.

But after a while she said that it was better tasting than any oil she had ever used and insisted that we reorder it.<br /><br />We use olive oil because we are concerned about our cholesterol. Just a little bit of Zoe is all that is needed to cook foods in an Orka steamer for delicious and healthy meals, microwaved in just minutes. We use it almost daily to make wonderful tasting, fish and vegetables that way. Chinese leftovers and rice tastes like it was freshly cooked when you reheat it this way with teaspoon of this oil.<br /><br />We recommend it highly!\n",

      "So far I've used this product only for a pasta dish or two and I like it. My recipe is a simple pasta and vegetable with olive oil dish. Cook up your favorite pasta shape and a veggie or two. I've used hariocot vert, chopped broccoli, diced tomatoes. Toss the pasta and veggies together with olive oil to taste--this can be a healthy dish if you don't douse it. Then sprinkle liberally with this herb mix. Don't be afriad to try a teaspoon or two--at first I was too careful about my measure. It's tangy without being spicy hot. Try it!\n",

      "This peanut butter contains added sugar, which is not what I'm looking for in a \"natural\" peanut butter.  Additionally, they remove some of the peanut oil and replace it with palm oil, which is cheaper and environmentally suspect in its harvesting.  I understand that these are all products that are of a nature-based origin, but adding ingredients to something that is already quite natural (blend your peanuts - you've got peanut butter!) makes it not natural in my eyes.\n",

The data on this from Tanya's guide for Crf cats shows this has pretty high phosphorous for a renal food.  .72% vs .38% on the K/D. Also has 36% protein vs. 28% with the K/D. Its more equal to senior formula foods than the prescription foods. It might not be the best choice. It does have high fat though vs other brands which is my hope for keeping some weight on my 18 year old crf cat.\n",

I am a tea drinker to begin with so if I find a good tasting organic tea at a good price I will continue to drink it.  It does have caffeine in it so if you are not a caffeine lover it wouldn't be for you.  I normally drink 2 - 4 shots of espresso every morning.  It has gotten to the point where all I want to drink is 1 tea bag of Numi Organic Tea!  It tastes good and has enough caffeine to give me the boost in the morning that I need.  It's also supposed to get rid of fat cells that are hanging around waiting to be filled again!  I can't make any claims about that.  I have lost a good amount of weight and have not gained any of it back.  So maybe my fat cells are going away when the fat leaves!  Whatever you are looking for, a good tasting tea, the claim that was seen on the OZ show, this tea is very special and I think you will enjoy it!\n",

      "When you compare the zesty Limonata Sparkling Lemon Beverage to other sparkly lemon beverages, you begin to realize the sheer perfection of the Limonata beverage by San Pellegrino. The balance of lemon, sparkle and zest takes this drink to the level of a gourmet beverage, which requires no mixing. I may have tasted this before, but recently ordered it while eating out at a Restaurant.<br /><br />San Pellegrino is also made with mineral water found near the town of San Pellegrino Terme which is located 70 kilometers northeast of Milan. The water flows from a thermal spring at the foot of a Dolomite mountain wall. The use of this water definitely adds to the energy this drink seems to possess.<br /><br />The carbonation seems more sophisticated and delicate. The only way to describe it is to say these waters are the champagne of sparkling waters.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

They use organic whey!!, yes organic whey! protein which is almost impossible to find anywhere and the best available kind.  All the antioxidants and vitamins are a huge plus especially if you work out as much I do.  I'm a triathlete and orthopedic surgeon so I like to review everything extremely carefully before consuming.  This drink is an 11/10 in every category!

I put it in a hot water bath and stirred and chipped away, but it took about 15 minutes of my husband stirring frantically to get the top liquefied to a spreadable state.  The bottom would not soften for the longest time for some reason.  After that bit of chaos, I was hoping for something really special.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  We tried our manna on pancakes (which is a great fiber filled option for a sweetener, instead of syrup).  The gritty texture and not quite sweet flavor was off-putting to me.  My husband loved it, but agreed it was gritty.<br /><br />I also dipped some chunky granola in it.  I found the texture and flavor easier to eat on the granola.<br /><br />We will continue to use it, but we know to prepare a bit of time to get this ready.\n",

My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.\n",

      "I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small \"made in Thailand\" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)\n",

I cannot stress enough how nasty this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is. The first impression was the smell and it actually smells really good. Second was the look of the drink - it has a yellow tint and these chunks of aloe vera pulp suspended in it. Shaking the bottle vigorously did not force the pulp to the bottom. Third - the taste. It is VERY VERY sweet, followed by the slimy pulp hitting your mouth and finally a bizarre aftertaste. When I say this stuff is loaded with sugar, I mean it. The Chantea is 11.5 ounces and is broken into two servings per bottle. That means there is 38 grams of sugar if you drink the entire bottle. A 12 ounce Dr Pepper has 38 grams of sugar and tastes better. If you are diabetic or concerned about sugar intake, steer clear! I won't buy this ever.\n",

I was pleasantly surprised. It has a light, sweet smell. The pack of 3 was convenient for me because I could keep 1 in the bathroom, 1 in the kitchen and give one to my mom. The temp where the item changes from solid to liquid is around 78 degrees. As the temperature has been warmer, yet I haven't turned on my AC yet, it spends more time in its liquid state. But when its solid, its still easy to scoop out what I need. As soon as it hits the skin, it begins to liquidize. It massages in easily. It also makes an excellent lip balm. The container suggests that it be used as a substitute for butter. I think it will work well (although haven't tried it yet). I recommend this product. Priced well.\n",

The older dog has few teeth left (she was abused and we rescued her). A lot of treats we buy are to hard for her to eat but these are the right texture and hardness. She can chew them up and she loves them as well. Perfect for giving to the dogs after they use the bathroom.<br /><br />The value is great. I didn't really think about how many boxes 6 of these were but the deal is that much better when you actually see how many treats you have.

I got a rubbermaid container that has a handle and pours and it holds the whole thing.  I grind the beans every night when I set up my machine and it is very fresh.  We like strong, but not bitter coffee and we drink it black no sugar.  This is rich full bodied but never bitter or acidic tasting.  I have been using it for over a year and I will continue to use it until they no longer sell it.  My in-laws like it so much I am planning to get them a subscription for Christmas.  We used to use Gevalia, but this is far superior and less than half the price. When I first ordered it I was afraid we would not like it because it was so cheap.

If you take calcium supplements or eat a lot of dairy, you might consider supplementing with magnesium. Calcium is used in contracting muscles; magnesium is used in relaxing them. If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax! My old massage therapist gave this to every client before his/her massage; she said she didn't have to work as hard to relax stubborn, tense muscles after folks had taken this. Hubby takes it on business trips to keep all systems balanced and avoid tension headaches from Atlanta airport!

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

Some only contained 4 or 5 pieces of candy corn.  Packs available from other sources are much more generous in their content.  So, if you are satisfied with a short count of skimpy treats, I suppose you might buy these, but I like a little more for my money.<br /><br />Note: Since posting this earlier review, the company seems to have corrected the shortage problem (I counted the contents of a bag purchased this year).  The individual packetts are still on the skimpy size.  There were some extra packetts, so if you discard the ones with only three or four pieces of candy corn, you might end up with 70 that each have about 7 pieces of candy corn.  That compares with a different source that has packetts with about 14 pieces of candy corn (at a somewhat higher price).\n",

      "Stewart's had abandoed us by no longer making the best of ginger beers.  Fever-Tree is a bit milder than Stewarts though not as sweet but unlike Goya which I tried to live with, it does not inflame your intestines on the way down!  It is obviously expensive and the bottles are tiny so I have two suggestions:  The first is that Fever-Tree consider selling the public the concentrate and let us mix our own.  The product I believe is made in the UK and shipped to California most likely in that concentrated form anyway.  By going that route or adding it to their product line, we would not have to pay for heavy glass bottles of fizzy water.<br /><br />My other suggestion is to mix a couple of inches from the Fever-Tree bottle with something like Arizona's very bland Diet Iced Tea.  It punches up the tea and certainly stretches the number of glasses of the ginger beer we can taste.  No one can afford these days to drink Fever-Tree straight on a daily basis.  But it is a worthwhile contender to the void Stewart's has created and I for one will never understand.\n",

      "I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention. They've perfected Stevia a great deal since the early days when I would dip a toothpick into the bottle and still use too much. It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.<br /><br />I grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.<br /><br />There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.\n",

      "We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.\n",

Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.

      "I am writing this review fully acknowledging that tastes are matters of personal preference, whether in music or in food. That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.<br /><br />In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.<br /><br />To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.<br /><br />Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.<br /><br />If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, \"I hate these. Do they have those Emerald almonds with the cocoa back in stock yet?\"\n",

      "This delicate looking plant was sent to me as a gift. I am not sure I would have ever ordered it for myself. Not really a big fan of the idea of  Bonsai. The packing/shipping materials kept it safe and sound (may want to open the box with a large trash bag around the box-packing peanuts galore) It looked very healthy and happy. As some other reviews stated about a week after receiving the plant LOTS and LOTS of tiny black bugs showed up. I have other inside plants and lots of outside plants so of course didn't want the bugs to spread. I squirted watered down dish soap (just a drop or two to a spray bottle of water) a few times, let it sit outside when we had large rainstorms. It lost a good amount of leaves (could be the bugs or could be the soap). Bugs died/washed away. After a week, new leaves started growing back. I waited another week and left it outside in the shade (sunburns very easily), later repotted it in a large pot. It's doing great, even though it's been through the wringer. I hope this helps anyone who has any of these problems.\n",

It might be more expensive than the \"cinnamon flavor\" or \"cinnamon extract\" you get in the grocery store, but it is so much more concentrated that it works out to be cheaper in the long run.  I made cinnamon hard candy.  To 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup I used 1 teaspoon (see update below) cinnamon oil.  That made a strong cinnamon flavor without being really hot.  Yum.<br /><br />Update:  The first time I made this I added the cinnamon oil when the candy was still 290F.  I got a cloud of cinnamon steam in my face and perfectly flavored candy.  I just tried it again but I let the candy cool slightly before adding the cinnamon.  I got less steam (but still a lot) and candy that was WAY too spicy.  I assume that the first time a bunch of the cinnamon oil evaporated, so the amount you need depends on the temperature of the candy when you add it.  Next time I am going to add 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon to the slightly cooled candy.\n",

      "I don't have cancer (at least as far as I know of), but I wanted to try this product because I heard it was good at psoriasis as it is a general blood cleaner.  I will say that it was mostly putting on a sprite shower filter that really improved my skin.<br />This product seemed to give me a small immune system boost, but otherwise I didn't notice anything else about it that was particularly helpful to my health.<br />There are 3 packets in the package if you didn't know already.. each packet can make about a quart of the stuff.  So the tea isn't cheap (course considering the ingredients and the scale of production, this isn't surprising).  Useful, but if you're already healthy, I don't think it is a product that is really needed.  There are other supplements out there that offer a better bang for the buck.\n",

      "My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!\n",

      "Not terrible, but not anywhere near as good as the Tazo Organic Chai tea bags. Now, you can't beat this price (on the 100-count bulk box), so it still may be worth the compromise in quality. I will say right now that I will likely not buy again and I will try to find the Tazo Organic Chai at the best price I can--which I will still pay even if it is double or triple what this is. Or perhaps by the time I go through 100 bags (50 mugs worth--the Tazo only needs 1 bag, the Stash needs 2) this will grow on me. I recommend honey as the sweetener for any unsweetened chai.<br /><br />The packaging is fine, by the way--except now owing to the complaints they use too much. It's still the same plain box with individually-wrapped teabags stuffed inside, but then that's placed in an oversized box with too much of that air-pack cushion that Amazon uses. This is the bulk size box, so don't expect a box that looks fashionable on your kitchen counter.<br /><br />Lowered rating from 3 to 2 after I found the Tazo at a decent price. See the comments.\n",

      "The quality of this cat food is excellent, with fish broth and the named fish (tuna, red snapper, sole, shrimp, or yellowfin) listed as the first (i.e., primary) ingredients.  It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.  If your cat generally likes fish flavors and you are looking for a high quality, healthy cat food, I would certainly recommend trying Petite Cuisine.\n",

You just have to remember to be vigilant, ask a lot of questions and read all labels and ingredients lists. Realistically, who is going to actually MISS crappy fast food (most of which is loaded with gluten)?<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago after peppering my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant with questions about their gluten-free preparation methods, I decided to roll the dice and order a gluten-free pasta dish.<br /><br />Wow.

Needless to say, I was wrong and felt fine after enjoying the meal.<br /><br />After trying countless gluten-free pasta types and brands: rice, buckwheat, quinoa, corn, etc. etc... Le Veneziane is absolutely hands down THE best gluten-free pasta out there period. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The owner of the restaurant gave me some to take home and then the hunt was on to actually FIND some in a store.

      "It's hard to put a *star rating on this.  I like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super.  They are hard to find in our local stores and I use Amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items.  However, this purchase experience was a little disappointing.  The crackers came quickly and in great shape...no breakage and the price was fine.  But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it's all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don't have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you can't save money if you toss everything that doesn't meet your approval.  Anyway, can't sieve crackers but I'm still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Don't want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.  This review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on Amazon.  Inspect them carefully, pop them in the freezer if in doubt, and enjoy.  The crackers get a 5-star rating; the purchase on Amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage.\n",

      "This chili is pretty good for canned stuff. I ordered this chili almost a month ago and it has been sitting in my pantry until tonight when I finally got the courage up to try it. I am not really sure what I expected. I have vague memories of canned chili from my childhood and it tasted a lot like an old sock in a tin can. I was pretty scared to try this stuff out. But things seem to have improved since the Time of Cave Man and this Chili is not bad.<br />When I first tasted this, it seemed really good, but then I realized that I was really hungry as I had not eaten a real mean, even a canned one, in two days, so I was prepared to adjust that opinion.<br />After, the first few bites where I was in the \"starving\" mode I began to notice some other qaulities that were not solely based on How Good the Chili tasted. The next thing I noticed was a pronounced Saltiness. I believe you could leave this stuff stored and salt alone would keep its shelf life good for years. That is how it tastes. The can states that it has 45% (or 1080 mg of a total 2000mg) of Sodium/Salt. It also states that it has less than 2% of salt. That may indicate that, by volume, salt is less than 2%. And that is true. But the average person should have no more than 2000 mg of Sodium/Salt a day. So I do not know who did their math, but 1080 is slightly more than half of 2000, so the RDA should be about 54% not 45%. Take it from me, this stuff is salty. I had my crackers out to eat with my Chili and after a couple of crackers, I ate Chili only. No need for crackers. A shame, as Chili is best with crackers. But they are not needed; in fact, it is painful to try to take in more salt than the Chili itself gives you.<br />The next thing I noticed was that the Chili was sort of \"gummy.\" The consistency is not quite right. Chili, right off the stove, has some \"soup\" to it. This does not. It is closer to the consistency of gumbo or chowder. It is quite thick. I am not used to it, so I felt it was a bit \"too full\" or \"gummy.\" Others may not be used to that small amount of soupiness. But, which ever side of the fence you eat your chili on, this is not the soupy side.<br />The consistency that I experience as gumminess may be fat. The Chili has 15% of your daily allowance of fat. That is a whole lot of fat for a 15 ounce can. That means 10% of the can is fat. That makes my arteries shudder. The only ingredients are water, beef, beans and crushed tomatoes plus spices. The only thing on that list that has fat is the beef. So, they are not using the best grade of beef in the world. But, then goodness, this is Canned Chili. That must be where the lower quality beef goes! Into my canned chili!! It certainly is not the beef that I put in my own personal chili!!!<br />So, that about sums it up for the Canned Chili. The taste is pretty good but salty. You get more than half the salt you need in one day from this can. Forget the crackers and the chips for today. You also get 15% of all the fat for one day in this can. The percentage for the fat is not so bad as the percentage for the salt, but if you think of 10% of the can being fat, it is not quite so appetizing as it once was. But then again, I point out that this is Canned Chili. The Health Nuts of the world are not out eating it. It is those others of us who won't or don't cook, and who are not really into all that health food suff. That is who eats Canned Chili.<br />So, for Canned Chili, I give it four stars. I knew I wasn't buying the most healthful stuff to start with. Really, I just wanted to have something to eat on the nights when nothing else was available. So, I figure, I really do not care about all that health information. I am just ticked because it is too salty to allow me to crush my crackers up in it. Dang! Chili without crackers!! So, four stars it is. I would give it three and a half and take off for the fat, the salt, and the less than perfect taste, but they won't let me do that. So, go ahead and give this a whirl. I'll eat it every two or three weeks. If you have to eat it more often than that, I recommend Something Else to protect your arteries and kidneys. Perhaps a salad would do the trick. So, eat it, but not too much of it!!!!\n",

      "I'm a pretty big cereal and granola fan.  You'd have to botch up pretty badly to make me not like your cereal - Kind Healthy Grains has botched up pretty badly.  On the initial bite, it wasn't too bad...it has a good crunch and tastes like a pretty decent granola.  I really didn't detect a blueberry taste to it, nor did I see any actual dried blueberries in there.  The vanilla taste was a little artificial tasting, but I kept eating anyways.  Then the weird flavor started kicking in.  The vanilla taste started tasting more and more nappy tasting, and when I stopped eating for a little bit, I got the worse aftertaste in my mouth.  I'm presuming it was from the flax seeds, but having eaten flax seeds in a lot of cereals and from the fresh flax I put in my yogurt, I'm not sure if that was the cause of the problem.  The aftertaste of this granola is pretty bad.  It just doesn't taste right - kinda like a mix between musty old nuts and artificial vanilla flavoring.<br /><br />I tried eating this granola with milk and it was still pretty bad.  My two preschoolers didn't seem to mind the cereal much, although I noticed that when I offered it to them after that initial bowl that they never wanted it again.  I'm guessing that means that they probably tasted that funky aftertaste, too.  After this experience, I'm probably not going to buy this cereal again.  Not recommended.\n",

      "Peppers are like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. Every pepper is different. I can tell you the bright red ones are the hottest. The orange ones are about as hot as a habenero. But if you want the full effect, eat a bright red one and chew it for 30seconds - 1 minute then swallow. Do not wash it down until after you swallow it. By doing this the heat stays in your mouth and not so much in your stomach and you wont get sick. The red ones are also very fruity tasting. It is quite good until your taste buds disintegrate from the intense heat. Your ears will then feel like they are bleeding. Then when the heat hits its highest point and you cant take it anymore...it starts getting hotter. I ate 2 of them before I got a hot one. About an hour later the heat is gone, but your entire body feels like hell. The effects are completely gone about 3 hours later. Thats if you get a really hot one and follow these instructions. But like I said, every pepper is different. Overall very satisfied for the price. I just chopped a half of one up and seared them in a pan with 2 chicken breasts and it was delicious.\n",

      "I don't know the true medical benefits of this product but I can sure tell you that after using the smaller size container I could for sure notice my body reacting to not having the Amazing Grass product.  I was much more worn down at the end of the day vs. having it regularly.  So I'm now convinced and drink this stuff every day, sometimes up to 3x's a day.  I love it and won't stop using the stuff, I love mixing it with Gatorade.  My body is much stronger and more regular now after using this product daily.  Thanks Amazing Grass... (Not a paid comment) I'd recommend you just try it once and drink it everyday for a few weeks.... You'll notice a big change for the better.\n",

      "Now I don't consider myself a genoa salami expert, nor do I really know what separates genoa salami from any other kind of salami, but I do eat a lot of cured meats and love them. I have eaten everything from the cheap presliced salami in the grocery store sandwich supplies to boars head to high-end, \"fresh\" artisan products. This is the worst thing I have tasted. Slim jims are better than this. It smells exactly like canned dog food and tastes exactly how I would expect canned dog food to taste, but saltier. Maybe this is what genoa salami is really supposed to taste like, but if you don't know exactly what your getting don't buy this.<br /><br />Update: I let it sit out of the plastic package and air out over night and it was actually decent. Nothing special but edible at least. It still had the dog food smell. I made three other guys at work eat it and the one who eats anything said he loved it (although he wouldn't give me $5 for the whole case). Another guy walked around with a sour look on his face for 3 hours and the third agreed with me that it was decent and would be OK with crackers and a sharp cheese, but was nothing special. Because of these experiences I have updated my review from 1 star to 3 stars.\n",

My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives.\n",

      "Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise.\n",

      "Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much.\n",

      "These arrived just a few months before becoming outdated!  It's hard to use up 12 good sized canasters in just a couple of months so I know I'll either be using them  beyond their expiration date or discarding them. The later will probably be more likely because as far as their flavor goes....they really don't have much flavor.  I guess I am just use to the regular raisins from Newman's Own or that other company.  I tried baking them in a homemade raisin bread but all they did was dry it out..unlike the other raisins I usually buy.  It was so DRY that I ended up throwing out over half the bread.  Why eat something that does not taste good!!!  Eating raisins out of the box use to be a favorite treat for me but NOT with these raisins.  I don't know why but they just are not very good on their own.  They are made from Thompson's seedless raisins and I know that variety is very sweet since I've grown grapes in the past but these defy this grape's normal strong sweetness and deliciousness.  I know I will not be buying these raisins again but you may like them so I'd suggest you buy a small box locally to try them first.  Perhaps if Amazon sent items that were not outdated or close to it I would have a different opinion but....buy these at your own risk!\n",

      "I love this soy slender cappuchino, 3 grams fat, 1 gram carbs.  I doctor many health foods to make it to my taste, and this one is no exception - I just add a touch of decaf coffee and it gives it a robustness, then I sprinkle cinnamon.  Yummm!<br /><br />I pour a half cup of it in the morning, then nuke it for a minute. then sprinkle some instant decaff coffee (I prefer Taster's Choice the best - it has the most delectable taste) and cinnamon and this stuff is delicious.  Not as screaming get up and go like a Starbucks coffee - but it does wake you up.  Highly recommended. Except for the price.  I cannot seem to find it in health food stores - wonder if it is in normal stores.  I usually buy a 12 case online from another company - its about $20.00 cheaper there than on Amazon.  I buy almost anything I need online from Amazon, so this is one of the very few products I do not buy from Amazon. Love Amazon.\n",

      "We have a decaf drinker and a regular coffee drinker in the house, so we have preferred the pod brewers for some time.  Basically, we have been pleased with the Senseo coffee pods.  They make a quite good cup of coffee.  Only downside I see is that a full cup requires two pods where, for example, Melitta required only one.  Haven't worked it out but I think that makes a cup of coffee a bit more expensive with the Senseo machine and pods.  That's a small price to pay (no pun) given the fact that the machine for the Melitta pods repeatedly failed and had to be replaced quite often. *** Update - February 2012.  Last order had two bags with pods that were not correctly sealed and spewed coffee grounds throughout the bag.  To make it worse, in each bag there were at least three defective pods.  This increases the cost of a cup of coffee considerably (over 15%).\n",

      "This Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce has the perfect name. It's got a strong, bold flavor. It has a thick, creamy consistency. It has a nice spiciness to it, about the equivalent of Tapatio. I tried it on tostadas, chicken burritos, and as a salad dressing for a simple lettuce, carrot, tomato and cucumber mix. I felt I gave it enough opportunities. It's just not for me.<br /><br />It has a chemical flavor to me, like I find with Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing. The ingredients are: soybean oil, water, whey (from  milk), vinegar, dried buttermilk, salt, egg yolks, sugar, spice, dried tomato, modified food starch, dried garlic, garlic juice, dried onions, xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast extract, phosphoric acid, gum arabic, corn syrup, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, natural flavor, artificial color, sorbic acid and calcium disodium edta as preservatives.  I'm not sure what flavor I am picking up on, but it's enough to make me not want to eat it any more. It really is the same thing I taste with cream-based dressings that are bought at room temperature, so maybe it is the dried milk or some preservative.<br /><br />If you like Hidden Valley Ranch or similar dressings and would like a spicy ranchero sauce, this could definitely be the sauce for you.\n",

      "I used to use Nutiva Organic 50% hemp protein prior to giving this a try. I have heard that Nutiva strips the Essential Fatty Acids and the omega 3's fro their protein. Manitoba Harvest consequently has 1300mg of Omega 3's, which is fantastic. This stuff tastes great in a post-workout shake with a banana, peanut butter, chia seeds, hemp hearts and sometimes a shot of hemp seed oil. I have had ZERO complaints about this protein and would recommend it to anyone looking to get into the hemp protein game; You will not be disappointed.\n",

      "If you're looking to use cinnamon as a *health supplement* I hope this review will help. I've been on a fitness regimen for a couple years and became interested in cinnamon because of Tim Ferriss' book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X\">The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman</a>.<br /><br />On pages 144-145 Tim recommends Saigon cinnamon, followed by Cassia *because* they contain the highest amount of \"coumarin\", a blood thinning drug that also affects blood sugar. This can be dangerous in high doses and Tim recommends taking no more than 1.5 teaspoons per day. Note that those types of cinnamon are regulated in Europe for the same reason.<br /><br />For three months I used <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SBI04A\">Saigon Cinnamon 7oz.</a>. I purchased this at a \"big box\" store for about $6, however it is no longer available locally. The taste is quite intense and *super* \"cinnamon-y\". I used a teaspoon in my coffee every day. I feel that it had a positive effect on my metabolism, energy and ability to maintain my weight. When that began to run out I looked for a new source.<br /><br />I read more (including reviews on Amazon) and wanted to try the Ceylon cinnamon (also called \"true cinnamon\"), i.e. the product sold here. Ceynon cinnamon has a minute amount of coumarin and is seen as entirely safe.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GKV8DQ\">Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder Spice Pack, (1 lb)</a> was the best buy in terms of price and customer satisfaction. It cost about twice as much as the Saigon cinnamon I've been using but it is organic and Fair Trade Certified. Delivery was super fast.<br /><br />The product is definitely more subtle than the Saigon variety in both smell and taste. I prefer the intensity of the Saigon variety, but that's a personal thing. This Ceylon variety has a bit of a \"piney\" scent and taste, especially in coffee. It's sweetening effect in coffee is far less noticeable than the Saigon variety.<br /><br />This Ceylon variety is ground *extremely* fine -- it's almost like talcum powder. Keep in mind that cinnamon is a wood-like substance and when you grind wood you get sawdust. In coffee this Ceylon variety is much less pleasant because it sinks to the bottom in greater quantities and it also feels scratchier on my throat. Compared to the Saigon I was using, there's about twice as much residue left when I'm done drinking. All this may just be due to the fineness of the grind.<br /><br />I will be switching back to the Saigon variety for medical, taste and texture reasons. But for the Ceylon variety this was the best product I found, it is certified organic and they deliver their product very fast.\n",

I was always curious about \"raw foods\" but was also very leery. For those in the fence who are interested for their cats or dogs, this product removes all the guess work. I am down to one cat now, a 17year basically healthy kitty, known by her finicky nature as she's had some health issues. I had tried another product which she sniffed at and walked away from, this stuff she LOVES even pulling the bag out from the cabinet. I give her about 1/4 a patty, with a traditional canned food, and she generally inhales it. If I put her bowl down without it, she sits and looks at me, plainly demanding \"where's my Stella's\" and does not eat until it's added.<br />4 stars as I have only been using it for about a month, but her coat and behavior is great, she's back watching out the window in the morning, she has tried the chicken and lamb so far and loves both. Patties are easily broken up and can be fed as treats or as a meal.<br />So far purchased locally but anticipate purchasing here, I got samples from a local pet shop initially.\n",

      "I got this conditioner to go with the hair oil of the same line. I don't have the shampoo, so I used it with my normal Pantene Pro V. Right away I could feel the difference in the conditioner itself; it was thick and dense, but not oily or heavy on my hair. It moisturized without stripping, a major problem for me.<br /><br />It says for scalp, but I didn't see any dramatic results on my scalp. You aren't supposed to apply conditioner directly to the scalp(it can cause dandruff and other similar problems), so maybe that's why.<br /><br />But my hair has remained silky smooth for a few days now, and stayed very un-tangly! A BIG bonus. I don't brush my hair that often as it makes it frizzy as all heck, but leads to huge dread like tangles after a day or two. This conditioner has kept my hair feeling clean and smooth without any other changes in my routine.\n",

      "I was skeptical at first using honey to heal a wound, but my nephew has surgery on his knee and the doctors used medical honey to pack the wound and it healed perfectly.  I had surgery on a pilonidal cyst in December and the wound opened up.  The surgeon told me it would heal on it's own, but it kept on getting infected.  I ordered the Manuka honey and applied with gauze and it instantly started to heal.  Within 8 weeks the wound had totally healed up(it was a deep wound!)I couldn't believe how well the honey had worked.  I am a believer. When my kids get scrapes and cuts, I put a little honey on a band aid now. Side note: I wouldn't use it to eat though, as it has a very medicinal smell and taste.\n",

They didn't have the Core Power 20mg protein available for a while, so I ordered the 26mg Core Power while they were in tranistion--anxiously awaiting the Core Power 20mg (supposed to be 'same as' Honey Milk).  I read the BEWARE review regarding the Core Power 20mg, but thought I would try it anyway.  MISTAKE.  I can actually TASTE the sugar alcohol.  Not good.  Tastes terrible and not good for your body.

      "I recently picked up a couple of packs of this mix at a local dollar store.  Like most people I am familiar with Marie Callender's products and I figured for a dollar, how bad could it be.  Well now that I have sampled it I am afraid that I have to agree with the other reviewer here that says its taste is downright weird, and honestly speaking, not like cornbread at all.  I followed the directions by adding an egg, milk, and oil, (1/4 cup of each) as directed, and even though it said it could be cooked in the microwave in a couple of minutes, I opted for the oven figuring it would come out better.  It cooked up easy and fast enough but that is where the pleasure of this mix ended its virtues.  Unlike most cornbread I have baked it rises really high in the cup and is very light and fluffy.  And it's is not crumbly like most good corn bread is either.  As for it's taste, there is next to none in my opinion.  I was taking big bites of the muffins with a generous amount of butter on them and still couldn't get a hint of corn bread flavor. And trust me when I say I have tried many different corn bread mixes in the past.  Everything from Jiffy to Larry The Cable guys brand. What taste I did sense was truly downright strange.  Not really awful, but as tasteless a cornbread I have ever had. It reminded me more of a cheap cake mix in texture and taste than a cornbread. I'm not even going to bake the other pouch I have. In conclusion, I would not recommend this mix to anyone, at any price I'm afraid... : (\n",

      "This product was not bad, but was disappointing.  The box promises \"roasted nut and honey.\"  While I could detect the \"honey\" flavor, rendered as a glaze more reminiscent of sugar than honey, there is little to no nut flavor.  In deed the product image shows each \"O\" covered in nuts and promises, \"nuts in every bite,\" the actual appearance is much different with no visible nuts on the cereal.<br /><br />The texture is fine.  The crunch holds up in milk.  It is more of an airy texture than say a dense Cheerio.  More the texture of Honeycomb brand cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally this product is mediocre.  Again not bad, but could be better.  Sugars rack in at 10g, less than many sugar sweetened cereal but still high.  Fiber is 2g which is something, but a bit low.  1g of fat is gaood and none of it saturated or trans fat.<br /><br />I will finish the box, but will not by more of these again.\n",

So if you don't care about organic tea, and you want a nice chai with strong cinnamon overtones, this is a pretty good one.

      "First off, allow me quote the label.  \"Tabasco Habanero Sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper.\"  What?!  That's funny, I don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients.  How is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim?<br /><br />False advertising aside, I bought a bottle for thirty-five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled.  The moment came and I shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig..and...nothing.  Minutes later, another big swig; a third of the bottle now gone.  I waited patiently to no avail.  Maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin, but not me.  So, thankfully I didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment.  Maybe ithe positive reviewers drank a whole gallon and that's where I went wrong.  Yes, I am a SHU snob, and if you need to look up what \"SHU\" is, then this sauce is for you.  Even Tabasco's website, which doesn't require a recall to correct, is loaded with inaccurate [read deceitful] claims.  I've had hotter jalapenos from Domino's pizza than Tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce.  Stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream Tabasco; you're way out of your league.<br /><br />That said, this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids.  Certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast.<br /><br />But hey, this is just my opinion.  Much like Tabasco's opinion on \"the world's hottest pepper\"; no real merit.<br /><br />Worth noting, this is only the second time I've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which I have little of to share my opinion.\n",

      "My french bulldog developed SEVERE allergies at around 8 months.  Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)<br /><br />This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.<br /><br />If your dog has allergies, try this!!  Don't let the vet sell you prescription dog food and put your dog on dangerous doses of prednisone.  My vet put my dog on the most common one sold; it was really expensive and I was so upset after I researched it and discovered that it has almost zero nutritional value.  (Look at petfoodanalysis. com as it does an amazing job of reviewing all foods and ranking them on quality ingredients, etc.)\n",

Matt the contact sent this message:<br /><br />Hi Kerrie-<br /><br />They are definitely strong in smell. If you have not smelled them before<br />they may seem a little odd smelling. The dogs think they are candy! They<br />should be perfectly fine. One thing to check is the bottom/underside of<br />the bag and make sure the \"best by\" date is still good. If that is in<br />range I would say everything is good to feed to your dog.

The ingredients in this food are quality, and the limited ingredients are easier for him to digest. I have also been told that grain free is easier on aging kidneys and liver; both of which have been a problem for my old dog. This is his favorite flavor, but the Venison is also yummy (to him, I've never tried it)\n",

      "I purchased this food after reading the many positive revieves for  my 6 pound Exotic who loves to eat, especially chicken. On opening I was surprised  how much like human  food it looked and smelled and was sure she would love it. Well, one sniff and she looked at me as if I were  nuts. My other more finky cat likewise.  I tried  again a few weeks later with the same results.<br />I then decided to let a neighbor try it since I did not want it to go to waste.  His cat had the same results.  No deal.  He  then put some out for  four ferral cats  he was feeding . NO takers.  It is hard to believe that not one  of seven cats would refuse something hailed as so tempting unless the food was defective..<br />I would not try this food unless youi needed some cans to hold up a bookcase.<br />If looking for a premium chicken try Instinct. A bit pricy but my cats love it. I also learned not to fix a good thing.  Cats are not like  humans and don't seem to mind the same food everyday.\n",

I couldn't detect any caramel taste to it.  One sip was enough for me due the overwhelming sweetness.  It tasted like someone had dropped a few dozen tablespoons of sugar in my coffee.  If you like extremely sweet coffee and don't care about caramel flavor, you might like this product.  If you mainly want caramel flavor, you would be better off with a caramel syrup or flavored coffee beans.\n",

      "First, as others have noted, the picture doesn't quite match the product.  As of 10/24/12, what you will get is a mix of cherry, watermelon, and grape taffy.  They also do not have those disgusting watermelon seeds or sugar crystals (EDIT: Apparently I hadn't eaten a cherry one yet, they DO have the sugar crystals, in my book that's one star off) that some of the Laffy Taffy has.  For some this is a disappointment, but for me, it's exactly what I wanted.  My only complaint with the product is again, as others have mentioned, this Laffy Taffy has been in a hot environment and melted into irregular shapes, not the nice flat \"bars\" that they normally are.  What this means is that little drops of the melted taffy have made it into the corners of the packaging, then when they cool down, they turn into crumbs that make a mess when you open it.\n",

      "Alba's Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "I go out for Korean food rather frequently, so I've become accustomed to the flavor of ice-cold barley tea. But, I will be honest: it took a few tries. It's very different from the types of tea you might be used to.<br /><br />Anyway, I recently bought this House brand from an Asian supermarket because it doesn't require any boiling. Simply fill a pitcher with water, throw in a bag, and come back in an hour or so.  The taste is just what I was expecting: mellow and earthy, without any bitter aftertaste. It suggests one bag for a quart of water, but it will make 2 quarts just fine.<br /><br />I give 4 stars not because of any flaws. The tea was fine in every way. But, there was really nothing to make it worthy of 5 stars. I imagine one day I'll find a Barley Tea that gives something extra, which elevates the medium with its subtlety and tone. But, House brand is quite good, and perfectly refreshing.\n",

The infuser is $12 and the shipping (to me - in the same state as the company) was $6.95!  Unacceptable. The thing weighs only a few ounces! #2 - MADE IN CHINA - also unacceptable.  Not to mention the made in China stickers on each of the two pieces that had to be peeled off and the residue cleaned thoroughly before subjecting the infuser to hot water.<br /><br />Come on Davidsons, you can do better on this product. Look for an American manufacturer will you?  If it's not your design or patent, design one yourself and have it made exclusively for you here in the USA.  Because as it currently stands, this is most certainly NOT the \"ultimate infuser\", to me anyway...\n",

He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later...

      "This is still better than Canada Dry.  When I lived as a child in the Detroit area (mid 1950's through about 1963 Vernors was available only in the greater Detroit area and southeastern Michigan.  You never forget the taste of your favorite soda as a kid, and I hahven't forgotten what Vernors USED to taste like.  About 12 years ago I found it here in California.  But it is next to impossible to find, and with most stores it's an on and off again availability situation!  However I just opened a can of regular Vernors a few minutes ago and am reminded that the formula has changed DRASTICALLY.  Mostly it's MUCH MUCH weaker tasting than when I was a kid.  It's mostly plain soda water... with only a HINT of the original Vernors than it was 50 years ago.  I still like it, but am VERY disappointed that since vernors was taken over at least twice over the years, that the owner has chosen to weaken the flavoring CONSIDERABLY.  Maybe they will see the light.,, but that is extremely unlikely considering who owns it now.  Vernors was I believe only second in sales around Metro Detroit (Coca Cola was first) 50 years ago. The reason I rated it at 1 star is because it's so MUCH weaker now. It originally used an extremely secret recipie that was truly in a high security vault.  Also it is NOW artificially flavored which means the entire formula has changed except for the fact they still use water! That is the only similarity vernors still has with the original formula. Perhaps the new owners have thrown away the old recipie.  It (was) the oldest soda made in America.  I say \"was\" because the REAL Vernors no longer exists.\n",

      "I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.\n",

      "Check out the first four ingredients on these snacks:  Brown sugar, popcorn, sugar, corn syrup.  That's a lot of sugar!  It's a little disconcerting that the popcorn is not the first ingredient.  These popcorn snacks are very sweet, of course, reminiscent of Screaming Yellow Zonkers.  They have no caramel flavor, which is a problem since the Snackwell's are supposed to be caramel popcorn.  The chocolate drizzle is nice, I like chocolate paired with salty-sweet.  The sugary glaze is so sweet that the chocolate actually cuts the sweetness!  The popcorn itself imparts almost no flavor at all, it's just a flavorless foundation.  The popcorn is nice and crunchy and with a good mouthfeel, though, not stale or chewy like other pre-packaged popcorn can be.  There are 130 calories and only 3 grams of fat, which is pretty darn good for a sweet snack of this size, but there are 24 grams of carbs, almost all of it sugar, if you're concerned about such things.\n",

      "I have to focus on the aspects that I can detect (taste and smell) and not ones on which I could only speculate (potency of antioxidants).<br /><br />This tea has very little flavor.  It smells as if it will have a rich, fruity flavor but that is not at all the case.  There is no raspberry in it.  The name of the tea is \"Green Tea Superfruit (Red Goji and Respberry)\".  It contains (green tea, natural flavor, soy lecithin, blueberry juice solids, concentrated goji juice solids)<br /><br />No raspberry at all... So I guess the \"natural flavor\" is raspberry flavor?  Why not just include raspberry juice solids or concentrated raspberry juice solids?<br /><br />Anyway, the net here is that it is green tea with a questionable attempt at being true to its name of \"Red Goji and Raspberry\"... It does not taste bad, it simply doesn't taste like much at all.  I will continue to drink it (and the other 5 boxes I bought in my six-pack), as there is nothing in the ingredients list that I specifically disapprove of and I will trust the antioxidant counts they provide, that come from the green tea itself.  I might turn it into iced tea in the summer and add lemonade to it so it will have some flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this again but would try another variety of Lipton (or other) Green Tea.  Other Lipton teas (like the Pyramid Bedtime Story) have been excellent.\n",

      "When I finally manage to convince myself to peel out from under the sheets each morning the second thing I'm interested in is a good strong cup of coffee. I categorize myself as a coffee drinker as opposed to a connoisseur since I'm amenable to buying whatever happens to be on sale at the market and spending my money on boutique blends happens about as often as the pope personally dispenses contraceptives.<br /><br />Now, my palate is sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between premium and plebian but the miserly gene invariably kicks into overdrive and inhibits forking over the cash for the former and definitely precludes an outlay for what my taste buds inform is a decent product yet well short of remarkable.<br /><br />The Marley organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a step above valued oriented Arabica but I was reminded of an ground variety with a bitter, burned aftertaste from the most notable of those upscale caf&eacute; house coffee providers (hey, I'm cheap and a hypocrite. If someone else is paying, I'm drinking).<br /><br />I tried the pods in a variety of ways (single cup brewing; steeped like tea for five minutes; open grind percolation; microwaved to the cusp of boiling) but regardless of method with eight ounces of water I found myself less than overwhelmed, and definitely unmotivated to order more.  Drinking it with cream and sugar was less offensive than black; the additives tended to mask the burnt aftertaste I detected.<br /><br />For some this group's commitment to social responsibility may influence a purchasing decision. Unfortunately, in my case that altruistic gene is in dormant state so it's all about the taste and price rather than ethical considerations.\n",

      "I've always been a loyal ZICO coconut water fan, and so was extremely excited to hear about the new packaging...and I have to say that I was MORE than pleased! The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go.<br /><br />The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too!<br /><br />The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials.<br /><br />Two thumbs up on the new packaging and the new taste profile!!

We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again.

This one does not.  If there is MSG in it, then there is so little that it doesn't effect me.<br /><br />The strongest flavor is green onion -- and it's very good -- followed by minced regular dehydrated onions.  It is a little salty, but if you add an additional 1/2c sour cream (or plain yogurt) it's perfect.  Or, if you're using it to dip raw veggies rather than heavily salted chips, it's not so salty.<br /><br />But that's just the beginning. Add 1/3 c of minced sundried tomatoes!  Or, 1/2 c of crisp bacon crumbles!  Or, go all out and makes a sour cream topping for baked potatoes with bacon, fresh ground black pepper, and some shredded sharp cheddar added.  Or, add 1t of Tabasco for a spicy onion dip!  Or, grill up some fresh onions and mince them into the dip.  Or, saute a handful of mushrooms!<br /><br />Not all this company's dips are as carefully pruned-down with the bad ingredients -- but this one works.\n",

I couldn't find them in my local grocery stores to try just 1 box to see if I liked them before buying a whole case of them.  But, no worries...  They arrived in perfect condition and were delicious!  Much thinner and crunchier when heated than your standard Ortega or Old El Paso fare.  They became very crispy with just a subtle, clean corn flavor when heated (I only heated for 4-5 min at 350).  My hubby doesn't like the \"musty\" flavor (his description, not mine) that regular store brands have; even if it's way before the \"sell by\" date, he thinks they taste and smell stale.  These shells don't have that problem, plus I like the fact that they're organic.  I will definitely be buying them again!\n",

They are slightly sweet and definitely quenches my need for a snack in the middle of the day.

Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.<br /><br />I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try...\n",

      "These stuffed mushrooms arrived with no cooking directions attached.  (I purchase frozen food online from another retailer---everything comes with cooking directions, times, etc...I am used to superior products.)  I perused the original site online for the proper cooking directions, then followed them to the letter.  First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage.\n",

Every sugar-free product containing malitol (other sugar alternatives too) I had ever consumed (which there were tons) over the years had always left a less than palitable aftertaste to me. When I opened my box and saw the packaging, I was very excited by the look of the caramels.

These little gems are really concentrated with ginger flavor; one might even say they're downright spicy.  The little bits of candied ginger are no small part of this potent taste.  They really impress as an old-fashioned style cookie, and remind me a bit of the British \"Ginger Nuts\".  As cookies go, they're not bad in the fat department either, with 130 calories per serving, 30 from fat.  If you like your ginger flavor strong, these are the cookies for you.\n",

      "I liked this product, for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />One is it's all natural. We get no preservatives, or corn syrup processed in any of it's many incarnations. We get oats, and chocolate. And who doesn't think chocolate should be one of the major food groups?? It's dark chocolate to boot, so not full of sugar and sweeteners that we don't need.<br /><br />The other reason I like it is that it isn't too sweet. It's definitely not a cheap bag of 'trailmix' from those major stores that's full of candy, dried sugar covered fruit mixed in with some nuts and oats perhaps. The only sweeteners I could find on the label were molasses, evaporated cane juice, and brown rice syrup. The semi sweet dark chocolate has some sugar in it, but that's ok, sugar is natural, as long as you don't make it one of the primary ingredients.<br /><br />A nice healthy and tasty snack food, that's what you'll find here. I don't think the kids will be too disappointed in the taste, it does have chocolate after all.\n",

I really didn't want to stick it in the microwave, but I'm far too lazy to heat it any other way. So I did. 30 seconds in the microwave pretty much tranformed it into something far creamier and more pleasant. Kind of like grainy almond butter....only better because it tastes like coconut, and I adore coconut. Yes, it is grainy, which is to be expected from a product made from dried coconut....some say floury, which I can see. It doesn't bother me, and I eat a whole lot of it on apple slices, or drizzled over sliced bananas with shaved dark chocolate.<br />The thing that really irritates me about this product is the HYPE. Good god. It's pureed coconut. It's a nice treat, but it is certainly not worth the effort of finding it (for me anyways...near impossible) or the money it costs. I feel like a bit of a sucker for believing half the people on here saying it tastes like the nectar of the gods or something. Artisana does not throw magical fairy dust in their product. You could easily make your own with a decent food processor and a bag of organic coconut flakes.\n",

After four months of use, the switch that engages at the top (safety feature) won't stay engaged, so I have to twist the top aggressively several times to get the machine to turn on - whether cooking or puree mode. So that's my first major disappointment.<br /><br />Second, the quality of the plastic doesn't seem to withstand the temperature of the steam, so the base of the main container has several cracks and leaks at the bottom. I am concerned about the plastic too - given how the steam is damaging it, I feel this may be one of those plastic that we are warned against heating foods in.<br /><br />For the price, I don't feel this product is worth it.

The contents are carefully prepared and provided in \"non-flow-thru\" bags, which are contained in a resealable pouch.  How controlled and sanitary this is, I would not know.<br /><br />What I was not quite prepared for was the experience of tasting the product, being that it was my first time.  To ome, Yerba Mate tastes a bit like some green teas.  It is slightly astringent and after my first cup, I felt that it benefited from the addition of milk and/or honey to round off a bit of the \"bite\".  I personally did not think that it was in any way a substitute for any other caffeinated beverage, however.<br /><br />Let's just say that this is an \"acquired\" taste.<br /><br />Up in parts of Northern California, I have seen other versions and brands of Yerba Mate and among some friends living in Mendocino, or Fort Bragg, it is becoming a sort of \"fad\" to consume Yerba Mate rather than teas or even coffee in certain circles.<br /><br />Since I purchased four packages of 25 bags each, I am \"set\" for quite a while.  However, I would certainly entertain trying other brands of Yerba Mate, for comparison.<br /><br />As they say, \"your mileage may vary!\"<br /><br />Happy sippin'<br /><br />Richard Links<br /><br />Berkeley, CA\n",

It needs to be refrigerated after opening and is good for 60 days.  The scoop is over twice as big as the scoop that came in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q1SYNQ\">Perfect foods Acai Powder</a>, so although the Sambazon Acai Powder costs less (and is just as good), the price probably comes out to be close to the same if you use the huge Sambazon scoop.<br /><br />If celebrity endorsements matter to you, Alton Brown recommends using the Sambazon brand acai juice. Since he's a food scientist, you can be sure he's researched his product.  Although he's not using the powder, the fact that he specifically uses Sambazon, gives me some greater comfort in using it because apparently, not all acai products are equal.<br /><br />------------ Seller Review 1 Star --------------<br />I hate it when people review the seller and not the product in this area, but this seller violated one of the MAJOR reasons I use Amazon. Also, there was not enough room in the seller review area for me to warn other folks, and trust me, you need to be warned.  So here it is...<br /><br />I enjoy using Amazon because I don't get put on junk email lists by sellers.  After buying this product, I received a non-Amazon email from the seller requesting my feedback.  I've been an Amazon customer for over 10 years and this is the first time I've experienced this kind of solicitation.  I'm now finding myself having to go to a non-Amazon website, [...] requesting to be removed from their marketing.  Are you serious?  Subscriptionloop.com?  That should send chills up your spine!  God only knows who has my email address now.  If you hate spam, the potential for spam, or don't want a company called subscriptionloop.com to have your email address, avoid this seller at all costs.  As most of us know, it only takes one mistake with your email address and then it's spam city.  I fear that I have made that mistake by using this seller.<br /><br />**Note: When I purchased this product in Feb 2012, it was being sold by Beepco llc (Sun Light Savings).  It now shows that it's being sold by Amazon, and if that's the case, then you shouldn't have my experience.  If it changes to Sun Light Savings though, you've been warned...**\n",

      "I thought the concept of this was awesome.  The packaging seemed prefect for portability; small with a spill-free pop-top.  It is available in nine flavors - Berry Pomegranate, Sweet Tea, Peach Tea, Mango Peach, Orange Tangerine, Fruit Punch, Strawberry Watermelon, Black Cherry and Green Thunder.  Just a squirt or 2 and I would have favor-enhanced water on the go.<br /><br />The reality was slightly different.  Although the packaging is small, the spill-free pop-top LEAKS.  I received the Sweet Tea flavor to sample.  The flavor was very inconsistent - sometimes a squirt would be enough for an 8 oz. glass; other times 2 or more squirts were needed.  It was almost like a science experiment (LOL).  Often I would have to pour it out and start over; once I had added too much the taste would be overwhelmed with an artificial chemical-like sweetener taste. YUCK!!!!!\n",

Because they're idiots who should be beaten with sacks of fresh clams, which should then be made into a soup that tastes like something.

      "We first discovered Dreamfields Pasta 3 years ago when we were pursuing a low carb diet. Also, I am diabetic, so even though I've lost the weight I wanted on the Atkins diet, and don't follow it faithfully any longer, I still watch my carbs AND my blood sugar.<br />I notice a reviewer disagreeing about the carb count. The thing is, as they say on the package, the EFFECTIVE carb count is much lower than most pastas. And that is, indeed, the tested experience of my family, and many other people who watch their carbs for whatever reason. If I check my blood sugar after eating Dreamfields Pasta, the impact  is way less than with other pastas, whatever the official carb count is. This may not be true for everyone. Your mileage may vary. But for me and many other diabetics, Dreamfields is a dream come true.<br /><br />The fantastic thing about Dreamfields is the taste. We really like it, and would prefer it to most other \"regular\" dry pastas whatever the carb count.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is with the prices: for some reason most grocery stores no longer carry the elbows and linguini. And when the shipping/handling is more than the (already) high price, buying it is almost impossible in the current economy.\n",

The best trait about these clusters is that they are great tasting while still being healthy.

I think they would taste terrific mixed in with some Greek yogurt as well.<br /><br />Each serving has 5 grams of fiber and 16 grams of whole grains, which is a nice bonus.

      "OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.\n",

However, when I opened the can I noticed lots of fluid and potato starch. After spilling out the liquid and rinsing off the potato starch (why is that there anyway? A filler?) The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same.

      "I am in NO way any coffee expert, connoisseur, or heavy user. To be perfectly honest, I had to look up how to SPELL connoisseur! But having a heart attack 6 months ago, I am learning to never use caffeine, salt, or almost ANY darn thing I love. And I HATE anything that is \"light\", decaf or artificially sweetened. My wife has bought about every single brand of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted \"real\" decaf to try in her drip coffee maker. Hated em all, just hated them. Saw this so thought I would try the latest brand I would hate since it wouldn't cost me anything.<br /><br /> First batch was way to bitter for me, didn't even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker. From that next batch on, I became hooked on this brand. I don't like the price, but love the taste.  That conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall. If I tinker with taste as I also add assorted coffee-mate creamers (also something I am not allowed anymore but REFUSE to give up), the taste goes to a 5 for me. Even with all the discounts if I order through the subscribe & save program (see below), I find this a bit pricey.<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />UPDATE: December 4 2010:<br />  It still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very 1st Vine Program Item I ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me. As a result, I raise my review from 4 stars to 5 starts. Another thing I like is I have no decaf \"aftertaste\" that I always experience with other brands. It is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing (for ME anyway) that I can still really enjoy, that helps me relax in the middle of all this can't eat this, can't drink that \"stuff\" going on in my life the past 6 months. It's also the time I haven't felt like I was compromising good taste for good health. For that, I am truly grateful. Just ordered the 3 pack on the AMAZON Subscribe & save page.\n",

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.\n",

      "I've been buying this juice concentrate for months now (at the supermarket) and I love it. The price here is a little more than what I would pay at the grocery store, so I've decided to keep buying it this way. I just had to say something about the poorly-researched negative comments here.<br /><br />Pasteurization is not \"nuking\". It has nothing to do with radiation; it's just a heating process. The juice is heated before being sealed in the can to kill any microbes that may be present. Many food items that can be stored at room temperature before opening have been pasteurized.<br /><br />Since you add your own water to this concentrate, the quality of your water determines the quality of the juice. If you have heavy water or a detectable amount of chlorination (like in city water), it's probably not a great idea to make juice mix with it. It isn't going to taste right.<br /><br />Additionally, since you mix it yourself, you determine the concentration (sweetness) of the juice. I typically dilute the juice to 64oz of water instead of the recommended 48oz. For one of the other two flavors, there's a one-star review that complains about the sweetness level of this concentrate. I cannot begin to describe how wrong this is. Maybe the reviewer drank the concentrate directly out of the can.\n",

      "I am a big loose leaf tea drinker, although normally I drink green teas.  I love jasmine tea, so I was excited when I got to try this product through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />The tea is nicely packaged.  It comes with an outside seal as well as a metal insert that can be reused to keep the tea fresh.<br /><br />For each teaspoon of tea you use, you can get a couple steeps out of it.  I wouldn't use a teaspoon for more than a couple cups of tea though; it starts to get a bit weak.  Although, this is not Oolong tea, so I am impressed you can get a couple steeps out of it.<br /><br />The tea has a faint delicate jasmine odor to it.  I was impressed with how smooth the tea tasted.  There was no hint of bitterness and the tea rolls smoothly around your mouth and down your throat.  The hint of jasmine is perfect.  It is a subtle hint that I have come to associate with high quality teas; such as when I get hand rolled green tea jasmine pearls of tea.<br /><br />All in all I am very happy with this tea and would buy it again.  Some people have commented on the cost.  All I have to say is some of the loose leaf teas you buy at Teavana (especially their hand rolled green with jasmine) is much more expensive than this tea.  Additionally this is an organic tea, which probably costs more to produce.<br /><br />I have a little bit of trouble buying teas online because I like to see and smell them first.  Given the quality of this Rishi tea, I would be comfortable buying other Rishi teas online.<br /><br />A great tea!\n",

It is dairy free (although processed in a facility that processes products containing milk). If someone is coming straight from chocolate to carob, this might not be a successful step. It's just not chocolate. It's carob. I like the flavor of carob. I really love these carob chips. I just melted a handful of them with a few drops of water, and put it on a pound cake I made. Delicious. I can't compare these with the old packaging version of them as some of the other reviewers are, but as someone who can't eat chocolate, and shouldn't eat dairy, these are not only the only choice out there, but they are delightful.

      "Do you like ginger? Are you aware of it's health-giving qualities?  Ginger has been shown to settle the digestion, to act as an anti-inflammatory, and may even shrink tumors and inhibit cancer cells. I've seen this specific product recommended in various articles on Naturopathic health. It TASTES healthy. It tastes great, too.<br /><br />Ginger Beer (as opposed to Ginger Ale) is loaded with ginger. And it's rarely more loaded with ginger than here in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW---At 26 grams per bottle, you can practically SEE the ginger in it. It has a lot of ginger \"bite.\"<br /><br />Unlike the soft drink megacorporations which produce a tasteless and overly fizzy sugar water they label as \"Ginger Ale\", Reed's microbrews it's soft drinks in a process similar to that used by a beer microbrewery. There is no alcohol in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW. 25% of REED's EXTRA is fruit juice, part of which contributes to the sugar content, which is comparable to other sodas. REED'S should be a treat, not a substitute for water.<br /><br />REED'S GINGER BREW comes in three varieties, ORIGINAL, PREMIUM, and EXTRA. The amount of ginger increases with each variety (It's a little odd that PREMIUM has less ginger than EXTRA). The labels are similar so check carefully to decide which variety you want.\n",

      "Atkins diet recommended and one cracker is perfect for breakfast with peanut butter - tastes like a piece of toast. For lunch, add a couple of tbsps. of tuna or chicken salad.  The cracker is too dry to eat by itself but is quite filling and tasty with a topping on it.  Since it is packed with fiber, don't forget to drink water!  Only problem, it's hard to find in local stores and it's easier to just order online.\n",

      "I've tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasn't been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose that's something.  I'm a moderate coffee drinker- I like 1-2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta \"Riviera Sunset\" decaf is smooth and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands.  The flavor is great and I've enjoyed it both hot and iced.\n",

I could not contain my excitement the day I knew that they would be delivered!  I got home to find 3 beautiful boxes with that memorable little squirrel smiling at me... I had to have a bowl immediately!! As I poured the clusters into my bowl...I thought to myself \"hmmmm...this doesn't look quite right\"  I procedeed with faith that it had just been so long since I had seen the cereal.  As I took my first bite I knew it was too good to be true... \"THESE ARE NOT THE HONEY NUT CLUSTERS I KNOW AND LOVE!!\"  I continued to eat hoping that I was imagining it or that it would just take a few bites to set in.  But alas...Honey Nut Clusters truly do not exist anymore.  This cereal is more like Honey OAT Clusters I do not see NUT Clusters.  I even checked the other 2 boxes to insure that the first one was not just a bad batch.  So to all those Cluster lovers out there...I am sorry...but the end is here :-( RIP Original Honey Nut Clusters!!! You will be missed!!  As for those of you in search of the next best thing...Let me introduce you to Honey Graham Oh!s and you can get them at a grocery store near you!\n",

Possibly it is a bit on the powdery side for folks who want their tea strained clear of bits, but I've never cared about a little roughage in my tea, so it seems fine to me. I had no difficulty detecting the added spices and I enjoyed them. This stuff is definitely worth a try if the idea of a flavored mate doesn't send chills up your spine.<br /><br />I've purchased a few things from Davidson's over the past few years and I appreciate the no-nonsense packaging and the promptness when shipping.

      "We bought these hoping they would be treats that lasted long and be good for the dog's teeth. I have a golden retriever that has NEVER had any sort of stomach issue. Anway after the second time giving my dog this chew she developed bad diarrhea and had to be taken out multiple times during the night which was a first. We didn't know what was wrong so put her on boiled chicken, rice, and pumpkin diet. Things firmed up after a day so we thought everything was better. Fast forward a few days and since we felt her stomach was better we gave her another one. What do you know? Diarrhea all through the night again! We went back to the chicken and rice diet till things firmed up. A week later we decided to give her another one. We had not yet put 2 and 2 together, we thought maybe there was some lingering issue and that is why her diarrhea had come back the 2nd time. Well after a week of solid poo we gave her another and just like that, diarrhea through the night again. We finally figured out it was the chews and we will no longer be giving our dogs these. We will be requesting a refund from the company.\n",

      "I prefer grinding my own coffee and using my Aeropress to the K-Cup for single serving brews. When I heard Starbucks was coming out with a K-Cup I was genuinely excited! For two years I've dealt with weak \"dark\" roasts. Iced coffees with a K-Cup are a joke. While nothing will come close to espresso out of a Keurig (I recommend the Mypressi Twist V2 if you are on a budget), the Sumatra Dark from Starbucks is the best K-Cup yet. It is smooth, dark and even brewed with crema. This is not acidic like many of the South American blend K-Cups. It is slightly more expensive, but it has made me start using my Keurig again.<br /><br /> I would have given it 5 stars, but one cup of the 5 I've made so far came out a touch weak.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you shelled out the cash on a Keurig. Get the Sumatra!!!\n",

They don't take long to cook, are healthy, and have a neutral flavor that works well with any type of broth or sauce. The ones I purchase from the store are buckwheat AND YAM.

Delivery was horrible. They delivered the package on a bright sunny day but the box was so wet that it disintegrated when i tried to pick it up. WTF? This is not Amazon or Hakubaku's fault.

      "We have three cats, and they all have VERY different tastes when it comes to food. One of them, my eldest (she's 15), will go through periods where she just turns up her nose at all foods, so it's a bit of a problem to find a food that all three cats will eat, isn't totally bad for them, and doesn't leave a lot of waste as well.<br /><br />AvoDerm is the favorite around here- even my 15 year old prefers it. It's the one food we can count on her to eat. And it's a good quality food- I'm not a feline dermatologist but we've been feeding it to our cats since it hit the market, and they all have lovely, fluffy, shiny coats and we have definitely noticed a big decrease in hairballs (one of our cats has the coat of a Maine Coon, so he's got a LOT of fur and spends a lot of time grooming).<br /><br />Also, the food can stand to sit out for a bit- with multiple cats, not all three of them are asking to eat at the same time, so finding a food that could sit in the bowl for longer than ten minutes without turning into a biscuit is a challenge. Whenever the 15 year old asks for food we tend to give it to her to try and inspire her to eat, so if the bowl she eats from sits out for a little bit and one of the other cats wanders into the kitchen a while after, the food is still fresh and not dark brown and crusty.<br /><br />So the cats like it, they eat a lot of it (even the refrigerated leftovers), it stays \"fresh\" in the bowl, and it seems to benefit their coats and health. I'm a fan and will continue to buy this food for my cats as they as they continue to benefit from it.\n",

These chunks of meat were easy to chew and tasted very good--they weren't grisly at all.  I was expecting there to be more veggies in there but there was just enough for flavor which is a good thing--means you get a lot more meat.<br /><br />Another plus is them actually using a healthy oil (olive).<br /><br />I'll buy these again, as I went ahead and did subscribe and save--and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />I'll be trying the Calamares (squid), by the same company, next.\n",

      "I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.\n",

      "I have two dogs that both like this toy. I'd rate it a 3 for one and a 5 for the other, so I've given it a 4 overall.  For one of my dogs, it's quite the challenge to get treats out of the center and he'll spend hours licking the outside \"caps\" if I put them on. And, even when he's done with the caps, he'll still lick the ball part getting every last scent of food off of it. For him, it is the perfct toy that amuses him for hours. For my other dog, she can literally pop the caps off and eat them in minutes. Inside treats take her a few more minutes to pop out. She's 15 lbs of pure chewing power with jaws of steel. Of the two of these balls that I own, one is starting to tear a bit in the center from her biting down to allow the treats to fall out.  Even though she can get the treats out and eat them quickly, I'm still rating it a 3 because she likes to play with the ball even when it's empty. Because it has flat sides, she can bounce it and it will roll, but usually stops before it goes under couches etc that will cause me to have to climb under the furniture to retrieve the toy for her. (That's always a plus!)The treats that the manufacturer sells to accompany this toy are rather pricey, so I will often substitute my own, more cost-efficient treats or dog-safe veggies/fruits. In short, I'd recommend this, but it's not a miracle toy that will stimulate every dog and dogs that do chew it a lot should be supervised for safety.\n",

Ordinarily I would not give my dog anything made in China, but I could not find any duck treats made in the USA. Well, recently I purchased a large package of these at a Pets Warehouse store. I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something.

I have been considering just how unhealthy my diet has become since moving back to Salt Lake City and reflecting upon my great physical condition prior to my move. Anyway, I've decided recently that there is no reason not to get back to that lifestyle and conditioning. A big part of that is what you eat and when. This item is a clear winner for getting back on track. It is very tasty, and while sweet, it is not too sweet. I particularly like the little bits of apple and blueberry, which is where the bulk of the sweetness comes from. Anyway, it makes a great and fulfilling breakfast for me, either by itself, or mixed with some yogurt. It also makes a great snack when you just need a little something, and is a great tide me over for just after a workout, but before you've had a chance to eat an actual meal (which i try to do about 45 minutes after a work out).<br />I'll buy this again.\n",

I will not use them again, though, because I don't want to have to do that after every use.\n",

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful.\n",

I use it when making a low point strawberry & peanut butter smoothie.  It is the best, great taste, only 1 points-plus for 2 TBSP, and guilt free!  My taste buds are dancing with pleasure.  For my smoothie I use 1 cup of frozen strawberries (in place of ice), 2 Tbsp of PB2 powder, and 1 cup low fat milk just blend for 1 minute and enjoy. Buy this product another way to use it like a spread on wheat crackers (just add water slowly making the consistency you like & stir). Also I have added it to a plain 6oz yogurt & 1 TBSP of PB2 and dipped a banana - if you're following a healthy eating plan you have got to try this as a new snack or even a breakfast.

This is a personal decision because for me, health is paramount in life.<br /><br />Here is part of an email I received from Xlear about their products in answer to my questions about the origin of their products:<br /><br />\"Good Afternoon,<br /><br />The raw Xylitol comes from China, shipped to Orem, UT and that is where we make the Xlear Nasal Spray.  Our Gum, Mints and Candies are all made in China. The rest of our products are made here in the states.  I hope that was the information you were looking for. Have a nice day!<br /><br />Xlear Inc.\"<br /><br />I find this especially troubling because the nasal spray has a big red, white and blue shield that says \"Made in the USA.\" So all the ingredients come from China and are put together in Utah. Can this really be legal? To say \"Made in the USA\" when all the ingredients are from China?<br /><br />If it is 'legal' to say this (yes, we have big problems with our own FDA)...it is still unethical in my opinion.

You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink.

The Altoid brand is better: more flavor, and more consistent.\n",

      "I tried these chips on a whim while shopping at COSTCO. They stopped carrying the chips and I had to look elsewhere for these delicious snacks. No local store carried them, so I turned to Amazon.com in hopes of finding them. As soon as I discovered them on the list of foods carried by Amazon, I ordered a box.<br />When the box of chips arrived, I opened a bag of the  Riceworks Salasa Fresca chips, only to find not a single whole chip. The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product, but, most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.<br />It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping. Because of the condition of the chips upon arrival, I will not buy them from Amazon.com again.<br />Great Chips when they are whole. A great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces.\n",

I picked these up because Amazon had stopped carrying Pemmican beef jerky (which hadn't been the same since the company was sold anyway) and I was looking for something to snack on. I like Slim-Jims ok when they're good (but quality control is a major issue with Slim-Jims, as for every good one you get, you're likely to get one that tastes rancid or worse).<br /><br />Obviously, these aren't like beef jerky, they're closer to Slim-Jims. The consistency seems to be much better than Slim-Jims and the price is pretty good. The flavor isn't as good as a good Slim-Jim, but is much better than a bad one, so it kind of evens out.<br /><br />I was hoping these would be closer to the \"Matador\" line of snack sticks that Jack Link's makes. For whatever reason, despite carrying many Jack Link's products at present, Amazon doesn't seem to have the Matador line.\n",

They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",

I have successfully moved my kids to healthy cereals and whole wheat toast, but these offer a nice \"treat\" for those days when we're in a rush or they are begging for a \"toaster pastry.\" I also plan to bring some to work to keep in my desk for that midday snack.

      "A company called Chero-Cola Co. had a line of sodas called Royal Crown in 1905. They reformulated one of their products in 1934 and \"Royal Crown Cola\" was born. Consumers called it RC Cola for so long the company finally made it official. \"ME and MY RC to taste mighty good to me\" was a popular commerical in the 1970's. It is not available everywhere, so some people are lucky to find it this way on Amazon. A very popular cola in the south, I have heard southerners swear by drinking a glass with a few shelled peanuts in the soda, say it tastes great that way. I have also heard that the combination of a Moon-Pie and RC was big in the 1950's but sounds like too much sugar for me. Either way the 1950's was their heyday and they spent tons on advertising especially with celebrity sponsors like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.<br /><br />Packaging: It is sold in plastic, glass and cans and like many sodas the glass bottle tastes better but good luck finding it. SMOOTHNESS: It is more smooth than Coca-Cola, but more uppity than Pepsi. CARBONATION: RC has average carbonation, the big two colas are a bit more fizzy. SWEETNESS: It is a little lighter in sweetness than the 2 big colas. COLA Flavor: You can taste the cola pretty well.<br /><br />In 1954, it was the first brand to be sold in an all aluminum can, the first to offer a low calorie diet cola, and a caffeine free soda. Four years later, they introduced the first 16-ounce bottle.<br />Dr. Pepper/7Up company owns this now, and they in turn were bought by Cadbury Schweppes a British company in 2000, who seems to be buying up all the soda companies in the country with the exception for the big 2. Check out their web site.<br />Update: As of June 2, 2007, Cadbury Scweppes is selling off their soda division. Let's hope someone keeps the regional sodas alive.\n",

      "Hi.<br /><br />I have been using the VIA instant coffee at the office for a while now.  This is my fourth or fifth order from Amazon for it.  The last two orders have been in modern, retail packaging with expiration dates four to six months in the future (which is fine for me).  I find that the expiration dates *do* matter with this coffee, as it tastes fresher (to me) before it is expired than after (I have had both on hand at the same time and have done a side-by-side taste comparison).  Early shipments were in what appeared to be commercial packaging not for display or retail purchase, and the expiration dates were very close (less than one month in some cases).  I promised myself that if the expiration dates did not improve that I would stop purchasing this product.  My past two purchases have been perfect, so I can only assume that the feedback from these reviews, and fixing whatever bugs there were in the pipeline, if any, has fixed the problem of expiration dates.<br /><br />As far as the product goes, it is amazing to me to taste an instant coffee that truly rivals the quality of what i can make at home with focused effort (grinding, measuring, vacuum sealing, filtering, etc.).  At work the water is of variable quality, so I bring my own spring water, use a cuisinart hot pot (on the green tea setting :-), and in a minute I have a quality-controlled, excellent cup of coffee (or a great Yerba Mate in the afternoon).  Life is good :-).\n",

      "Yessiree- this is the same sweet coffee-esque sugar buzz that you'll find at most convenience stores and gas stations. Is it a chemical abomination? You bet! Does it taste great with a day-old buttered roll in a wax-paper sleeve? Absolutely! Here is the real thing that fogs your windows and leaves a vanilla aroma in its aftermath. It is sickeningly sweet and guaranteed to snap you out of a hangover when followed with a day-old roll or bagel with cream cheese. Nothing short of an American classic and friend of the open road.<br /><br />It's not just about the sugar. They actually put 30mg of caffeine into this concoction of--well, you really don't need to know.<br /><br />It's cheaper than the $1.75 at the gas station (around $.45 a paper cup).<br /><br />It's not actually coffee-- but it hits the spot when you're down and out and need something more for breakfast than a Baby Ruth Bar.<br /><br />Go ahead- you know that you want this, uh...whatever it is. Mmmmm! Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!\n",

I never thought that anything like this could ever be consider a lollypop by North Carolina standards, but trust me, once you taste one of these, you won't want to switch back.

Hint--add a little canola oil (I don't know why the canola works and others haven't, I learned it from a chef a a celiac camp I went to last summer with my son--and it works) to the water while you are boiling and stir stir stir--I use a spaghetti spoon.  Do not walk away...If any of the strands start to stick together, use a fork and gently press against the side of the pot to make them come apart...then continue stirring. It's 8-10 minutes out of your evening, but if you miss spaghetti, it's totally worth it! This is not a pasta you want to assign to someone with ADHD (my husband cannot stand over the pot for the total of 10 minutes of stirring it takes..he grows bored)  lol, my point is that you have to pay attention to it to get it done right, and when you do it right it is just like regular pasta!

There are remnants of the garlic husk in the seasoning - a bit unacceptable - should be the pure garlic bulb<br />2. The product is packaged in the US but from garlic imported from China. Since we have Gilroy, CA - I have no idea why we need to get our garlic from China - other than cheaper cost - but quality suffers and I like to support our farmers here in the US - so will I'll be looking for US made in the future.<br /><br />The blend is course - so be aware - it is not a fine powder type blend.

The package arrived promptly via USPS, but in an awful state. The small cardboard box was SOAKED in oil, so it got all over my mailbox and other pieces of mail, and dripped all over everything. My only gripe is about the awful packaging. All it had for protection was a flimsy sheet of bubble wrap! I have posted a photo of the jar that I pulled out of the box. I filed a return claim and was contacted by NetRush, but I forgot all about it after a few days. I'm sure I could have gotten a refund but I missed the deadline. That was my fault, not theirs!

      "I think Amazon is on the right track by offering groceries, but I think you need to stick to major brands and work a bit more on making your pricing competitive ( it was still quite a bit more than Safeway, not to mention Wal-Mart).I expect to pay a little for the convenience but not quite as much as I did. The rice crispies were a little \"different\" than I expected.I don't quite understand why you make us buy quantity when your packaging is not pre packaged? I expected to get four boxes somehow stuck together or banded together to ease your shipping costs and was quite surprised to get cereal one or two boxes of cereal to a shipping box.If that is how you are going to ship it wouldn't it be better to let us buy smaller quantities to increase your overall sales?\n",

The berry flavor's not too bad-it tastes like liquified smarties. I also liked the fact that it promises that you won't crash (I had several classes and work the following day) and that it's only 4 calories. The no-refrigeration is also handy when you only want to drink half of the bottle.<br /><br />I drank a whole bottle after deciding that half wouldn't give me enough juice to stay up. I did start feeling it after a couple of minutes and I actually lasted for about 8 more hours before I started feeling drowsy. There was no crash and I didn't feel any bad effects. I definitely recommend this to anyone and plan on using it again.\n",

The other night , I did not have time to bake them so I just put the batter in the fridge. The next day, just used a small icecream scooper to form small balls and put them on the sheet. I usually spray the small scooper with PAM and scoop up the dough and the balls will pop right out...have uniform size cookies! Hope you will try the recipe...you will not be disappointed!!<br /><br />You can also put a scoop of icecream between 2 COOLED cookies and have an ice cream sandwich!\n",

      "After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried. We took the effort to slowly introduce the food and gave it a good 4 months before finally giving up.<br /><br />Our dogs did not seem to really like this food. I am not sure if it was the taste or if it was the terrible gas or diarrhea it gave them. It would sit in their bowl for hours before they finally gave in and finished it.<br /><br />After much thought we decided that we would rather our dogs enjoy their food and not suffer from daily diarrhea than force them to eat this food, even if it might extend their life a little.<br /><br />We settled on Science Diet brand. They gobble it up at every meal and have returned to normal bowel movements. I realize the ingredients are not as good as Wellness brand, but I feel better about their quality of life.\n",

With Culinary Teas brand, I had to add vanilla and sugar to the latte to make it palatable. Even though this costs more than Culinary Teas, it is worth it. I still add a bit of sugar to the latte though. The packaging is terrible, some form of hippie foil bag inside a cardboard box.

One batch with 97/3 burger and one was sirloin no fat i striped into slices my self. Burger has the spice mixed in it at the start. The meat strips had to be marinated in the spice mixed with water to soak up the spice. marinate in refrigerator for 4-6 hours. I did put far more water than it called for per pack of spice to have enough to liquid to be above the level of the meat in the marinating bowl. I thought it would be a waste of the liquid left over after marinating, bit I just put the remainder in the freezer to use/add to, next time.

      "I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is \"supposedly\" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.\n",

      "Monster Energy gives you the buzz and kick you need to keep you going. I have been drinking these for almost 3 years now and they are great. I ordered my first 24-pack case of these yesterday on Amazon with $3.99 Prime overnight shipping and now they're in my fridge cooled and ready to drink :D<br /><br />Just a word of advice, though. Drink these energy drinks in moderation. Even though the label states to limit 3 cans per day.. just drink 1. Really, you'll feel a lot better drinking one for the day instead of going all out and chugging half the case. There is 80mg of caffeine per serving, 160mg if you drink the entire 16oz can. If you really need two, spread them out hours apart.. one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. The maximum caffeine any person should take in a day is 300mg, but try to keep it at 200mg and lower at most occasions. And if you can, drink one every 2-3 days.. be strong of yourself and avoid the addiction of caffeine this product brings you. This way, you can still enjoy the biggest, baddest energy drink on the planet without risking you with health effects that occur when taken in excess.<br /><br />Don't believe all the hype that energy drinks are truly bad for you. I call any energy drink a \"neutral beverage\", because it's not good for you, but it's also not bad for you. You'll get it :)<br /><br />Also, if you're looking on cutting down on sugar and carbs, try the Lo-Carb Monster (blue)... it has a more sweet taste than the regular one and you'll feel guiltless drinking one. I believe it doesn't contain the evil \"aspartame\" from diet sodas and such, so try it :)<br /><br />Unleash the Beast!!!\n",

      "These comments are for \"Newtons Fruit Thins - Blueberry and Brown Sugar\" sold by Nabisco.<br /><br />The package states \"crispy cookies\" think the firmness and thickness of a graham cracker - yes that firm. These 3-inch round wafers come in a rigid plastic tray that slides into a foil-lined package. Nonetheless several cookies in the two packages I sampled were broken into several large pieces upon opening. Probably not typical but that's what I observed.<br /><br />I found the cookies brittle; they had a tendency to break into several pieces after a bite. As an adult I could compensate be adjusting my method of holding the wafer but children will have a problem.<br /><br />I found the blueberry and brown sugar cookie without much flavor. The package state \"made with real fruit\" therefore what you have are many small pieces of dried blueberries throughout the cookie. The consistency was adequate but the flavor must have been baked out during the process.<br /><br />I was somewhat taken back by the work \"Newtons\" in large letters on the package. My understanding of this term is of a soft chewy fruit filled cookie like a fig or apple Newton. I do see the connection then again I am not in Sales or Marketing where these decisions are made.\n",

The color pictured on the can's label shows pineapple that is bright yellow and vibrant. Alas, the pineapple in the can was more of n off brown see through, mutated something or other. Not yellow at all. Not bright and vibrant at all. Now let's talk taste, because even if the color was off (by a lot!) at least it still tasted good, right...? Wrong! This tasted like cheap imitation pineapple that airlines wouldn't even serve back when they served meals. I gagged at almost each bite hoping the next one would be better.

A nice touch was that it is delivered in a vacuum seal bag with a heavy duty zip-lock on it, so it seals tight - just make sure you roll the air out of it when sealing it shut. I call it \"fairly fresh\" because, although the description says \"roasted fresh immediately prior to packaging,\" I would question if they sit in the Amazon warehouse a long time due to the dryness of the beans we recieved. Keep in mind it is normal for lighter roast beans to be dry, but these were a tad extra dry.

      "The natural sweetness of both nuts, and the rich oils from the macadamias, made this rich spread an unbelievable treat.<br /><br />Though I am not typically a \"chunky\" fan, the bits (rather than chunks) of nuts throughout didn't seem to endanger the creaminess of this nut butter. In fact, at room temperature I found it a bit too \"melty.\" Once stirred and refrigerated, it became the perfect spreadable consistency.<br /><br />Because of the light sweetness, I had anticipated devouring this as a healthy \"frosting\" on brownies or graham crackers - but I found another unlikely yet delicious match, Tamari with Seaweed Organic Rice Cakes. I can't quite say why (nor can I say what possessed me to trial this combination), but the sweet, salty, and earthy flavors simply melded into the perfect savory snack that pretty well eliminated my afternoon sugar craving.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? As good as it is, it is hard to justify such a price tag for a half pound jar. Easily devoured within a week by a single person (that would be me), it turns into a pretty spendy snack! Nonetheless, if you want to enjoy some of the best, I recommend it.\n",

      "The Chi-Chi's restaurant chain used to sell a dish called \"Enchiladas Cancun\".  Recently I decided to see if I could find the recipe because I missed my favorite dish.  All the internet searches for the recipe were more or less identical & said to use this ingredient.  I was hesitant because this product isn't cheap so I made the dish for the first time with a substitution & without this ingredient.  The enchiladas were okay, not great, so I thought that maybe my memory of the dish was probably better than the fact.  I tried to talk myself out of this product because of the cost.  One day in a fit of impulse buying, I finally decided to buy it.  I'm so glad I did!  I made the sauce last night & made the enchiladas today & it was like being back at Chi-Chi's.  If only I had the Spanish rice & corn cake to go with it!  I'm also going to take the basic sauce recipe to make an incredible pasta sauce with this base.  It was definitely worth every penny & the cost of the base is still cheaper than ordering a meal at a restaurant.\n",

These tortillas are on the thin side, which is a big plus for me, as I dislike thick, doughy tortillas.<br /><br />These are what I would describe as the \"standard\" diameter size.  That is what I wanted and expected.  However I am pointing this out because they are labelled as \"for burritos\".  Where I come from, that would mean the very large diameter tortillas.  Just thought I'd mention that so everyone is clear on the size.<br /><br />Also, these packages contain less tortillas per bag than I usually encounter.  Again, where I come from, tortillas are usually bagged in packs of a couple dozen at least!  These contain eight tortillas per bag.  I actually like this, as I can keep one in the frig for quick and easy use without worrying about them drying out or going bad.  The unopened packages store well in the freezer.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase this product again.\n",

I should note that I'm also taking a multivitamin, a hair/skin/nails vitamin, and flax seed oil capsules (all vegan) once a day, so if I see improvement in the condition and clarity of my skin, it's as likely as not that both resulted from the many changes I'm making to my diet and lifestyle choices as from this tea.<br /><br />However this is still a really delicious, soothing blend of rooibos, chamomile, orange peel, and several other herbal ingredients.  I'm not big on fruity teas, but Get Gorgeous has just enough fruity flavor to keep a drinker from needing to add sugar.  The dominant flavor is definitely a soothing herbal one.<br /><br />Since I live in the South, where sweet tea rules all, I would recommend this to anybody who wants to give up sugar-sweetened tea without sacrificing a familiar flavor.  I've never liked sweet tea, but I have tasted it, and Get Gorgeous has a similar (though not nearly as strong) sweet taste that I think would go over well with health-conscious Southerners.\n",

I took my first cinnamon raisin swirl sandiwch to work today, and although it IS gritty, I love the taste.  To me it tastes quite a bit like a cinnamon roll- even if it does have a different texture.  I put some extra raisins on my sandwich, because I didn't think there were enough in the peanut butter- but since it would be hard to dig them out, it's probably better they erred on the side of caution.  If you, like me, would like more raisins- add some.  I think tomorrow I may mix this one with the chocolate.  I like cinnamon and chocolate together, so I'm going to try spreading one side of the sandwich with a thin layer of cinnamon peanut butter, and spreading the other with the dark chocolate.  At any rate, I'm very satisfied, and I'm looking forward to trying this on apples (which the jar recommeneded)\n",

      "I am not one for coffee that is over roasted or extremely strong.  But after reading other reviews and seeing the prices, I signed on up to try both the Breakfast and Rainforest blends.  Some said they were similar to other Kcups they had used, like Donut People, and I have to disagree.  Even upon receipt I could smell the over roasted aroma, but gave it a try.  Luckily we'll have enough company to kill 160 of these things...and I will suffer through a few 12 oz brews (to get it as weak as possible) myself.<br /><br />If you like Green Mountain Kcups, stick with them...this is not what you are looking for.<br /><br />****Updated August 26, 2012****<br /><br />I always try to be fair in my reviews and while I purchased two blends from San Francisco Bay Coffee for my Keurig and am not crazy about them, I must say that my opinion of the Breakfast Blend has changed enough for me to update this rating and review.  I still do not like the Rain Forest Blend I also purchased, but decided I would force myself to drink these as I had bought such a large box of both.  What I have found is that on a 12 oz setting the Breakfast Blend is not too bad.  It took a few days to get used to, but I am now good with it.  Heck, for the price over Green Mountain K Cups, I might even buy this one again.  In the end I am getting a 12 oz cup of coffee vs 8 oz and like I said, the flavor grew on me once I had been drinking it for a few days.\n",

      "If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium.  This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium.  My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night).  A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this.  As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate).  After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared.  One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I have only two problems with the product.  First, this particular flavor of Natural Calm neither tastes nor smells all that great:  it's sickly sweet.  However, there is a non-flavored variety which is great (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ2DL4\">Natural Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 powder</a>).  Also, it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  I've subtracted one star from my rating for those.  But, still, I rate this at a Very Good four stars out of five.\n",

      "Today was my first day trying out these. I have already finished eating 3 cans of this Matar Paneer. So frickin tasty the were! I ate two cans warmed with rice and 1 just by itself. The taste comes from the spices and sour cream combination. Be warned that there is a lot of soy bean oil used to keep this from going bad. 1 can amounts to 560 calories of which 400 is from fats. I think a moderate quick meal can be eaten with half a can of this and some rice that will keep you filled for at least 3-4 hours. I found that there are only about 8-10 cubes of paneer in this thing, about as much as shown in the picture. That was kind of a let down as i like paneer. But the rest of the stuff with pleasant gravy were good enough eaten with rice. A must buy at $2.6 per delicious and fulfilling Indian meal.<br /><br />i find the salt not a problem as i work out daily and sweat away lot of salt anyway.\n",

I have been searching for years for a product that can take care of face and body breakouts and finally found this.  It's not even advertised as an acne treatment, but it is the only thing that has ever worked. I have naturally oily skin, I suppose, so the drying effect described by many is beneficial for me, as it returns the skin to normal.  It leaves your face feeling tight, but not dry.<br /><br />I will definitely attest to the fact that this is a different product than the same label in the store.  The review that mentioned this was much more watery and less scented hit the nail on the head.  However, It still does the job. It's just curious that it's different.<br /><br />I could by 3 smaller bottles at my local grocery store for close to $20 or get three huge ones here for 15.<br /><br />All in all, if you have oily skin all over, this works.

      "My dog loves his ZP. He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say \"you gonna give me some of that?\" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.\n",

The rich aroma and full flavor are a delight, and I don't find it overly acidic (it's certainly MUCH easier on my stomach than American-style drip coffee, and this from someone with strong stomach and a love of all kinds of drip coffees). I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen.

      "Lucid was the first brand available in the US since the 1900.  French in origin and true to vintage recipes.<br /><br />This is a verte absinthe, which means that when you pour it on a glass, you will see it has a nice soft yellow-green color.  The louche (the result of adding water to it) is mostly white, with some green hints.  The main aroma is anise, but the taste is anise with a quite bitter after taste.  I drank it mixing it 1-5 with ice water and one sugar cube.  The sugar did not modify the bitterness, and the taste remained in my mouth for quite some time.<br /><br />I had read many good reviews on the Lucid.  Most people would agree that it was a good starter absinthe, and not too overwhelming for beginners, but I could not get past the bitterness.  Maybe it was just my batch and I had bad luck with it, but I can not say I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />However, I would rated it 3 and a half stars.  Specially because after trying other brands this is still not one of my favorites.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.

      "Nabisco has done it again with this great new product. It is not exactly a cookie, and it is not exactly a cracker, but something in between.<br /><br />These Fruit Thins are called crispy cookies on the packaging, and they are crisp enough to seem like a cracker, but they are not dry like a cracker. They have a wonderful fruitiness about them. I had the blueberry and bown sugar version, and they had real pieces of chewy blueberry in the cookies.<br /><br />They are not heavy like some rich desserts, but have a rich flavor. I like that they are made with unbleached flour, which gives the cookies a warm brown color. I especially love them with hot tea; my husband likes his with coffee. These Fruit Thins make a great snack or a light after dinner dessert.<br /><br />Three cookies are only 140 calories, with 5 grams of fat, only 90 sodium, and only 8 sugar grams.<br /><br />The packaging is nice in that the cookies are not loose in the bag but set in a plastic tray. Now I know that environmentally, this is extra packaging, but I like the tray because it keeps the cookies from getting crushed in transport/shipping.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent snack or dessert.\n",

      "MacMate deserves an obvious five stars rating, not only because it is our house brand but because this is a new, natural, sophisticated and eco-friendly coca tea.  Most boxed coca teas, Bolivian or Peruvian, are more or less the same as the techniques used for production are very similar with the same contents and weight per tea bag.<br />I have been drinking coca tea for 32 years and have tried them all and liked most. But with MacMate Air Tight Bag, we tried to create an exquisite gourmet tea which is produced differently versus the traditional techniques used for 100 years in Bolivia (Windsor celebrates its 100 anniversary this year).  Specifically, we have obtained the finest selection of organic coca leaves which are free of pesticides and chemicals and arranged for them to be tested in US laboratories.  Thus we have pioneered a top-notch process encompassing all steps in the processing of raw coca leaf to the final tea bag. The coca leaves go through a slow dehydration process similar to that of slow roasting coffee beans to get a humidity free product to prevent bacteria or fungus from developing and then we crush them into large flakes instead of the powdery-like content used for most brands.  Our filter paper is bleach free and recognizable by its beige-like color instead of the traditional bright white.  We opted for the golden Air Tight bag (Double Saran Coated Polyester) to guarantee the absolute freshness of the product and discarded all paper wraps that can interfere with the coca tea flavor or over dry the delicate tea bags. Our Air Tight bags do not \"breathe\".  The technology used is similar to that used to pack electronic components.  They have a zip lock system and can be recycled or reused.<br />The best thing about MacMate is it freshness.  The tea is only produced one time per week in Bolivia and only for the American market and as soon as it leaves the factory it is packed and sent by air cargo with a three to seven day transit time.  After that it is mailed from Charlotte, NC to all of our customers worldwide.  Enjoy MacMate Air Tight Bag Tea!<br />Sincerely,<br />Carol Blenda Reyes Avila<br />The employees of the Reyes-Avila Corporation\n",

      "I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well.\n",

      "We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.\n",

The older Cosmic Catnip size was no longer for sale, and had lasted a while. After about a year of trying to get decent catnip locally, I came back to Amazon. Read the reviews, and came back to Cosmic catnip (now in a slightly larger size container).<br /><br />This stuff is great, my cats respond to it well, and they love it. The biggest problem is they have really been using the cat scratcher we put the catnip on much more than usual and have had to order a refill kit.<br /><br />If you want very good catnip at a very reasonable price, this may be a good choice.\n",

      "This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a \"half diet\" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.\n",

      "Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!\n",

Still would have preferred stones, but they provided what was described so I'll give em their stars back =)<br /><br />PS- Still get rocks or more soil. What they give you isn't enough even to hold the plants upright. Still not taking stars, they're gorgeous little plants, I'm happy. =)\n",

      "My youngest son (age 12) gave this treat a rating of 8 (on a scale of 1-10), saying he would buy it again (I didn't ask whether he would consider using his own money).<br /><br />His older brother called the confection \"boring\" but indicated that he would be glad to pop a boxful into the shopping cart at the grocery store.<br /><br />My husband, giving it a 6 on the scale, described the bar as having little flavor and a weird squishy texture.<br /><br />But what you really want to know is \"what does JoAnne think?\"<br /><br />I am a peanut fan, and Paydays were my favorite as a kid.  I haven't had one for a few decades so I can't really compare, but I do recall a sublime peanut-rich candy experience.  The peanuts in the Big Nut, in contrast, seemed flavorless and borderline stale.  I didn't realize until I started to write this review that the bar also contains almonds and cashews, so I can't say they made a huge contribution to the taste.<br /><br />Other reviewers complained about the number of sweeteners and other unwholesome ingredients in this bar.  Maybe \"granola\" implies healthy to some (it doesn't to me) but I don't expect much nutrition from a candy bar.  I do expect a candy bar that calls itself \"big\" to be somewhat larger than real small, and this bar struck me as below average in size.  But then, candy bars in general are a lot smaller (and cost a lot more!) than when I used to eat them every day.<br /><br />That said, the dominant note in this mix of 30 or so ingredients was the corn syrup.  It overpowered the peanut taste and left the kind of remorseful aftertaste that made me ask myself why I'd just wasted 220 calories.  I realize that corn syrup is ubiquitous; I wonder if the purveyors of cheap candy bars realize how offensive it is to so many of us?<br /><br />Would I buy it again? No. I gave it three stars because the boys liked it, and if you have some of them in your family and you want to get them a treat, this might be your bar.  Me, I'm sticking to chocolate.\n",

      "Recently we've decided to cut down on our sugar intake. So at a Whole Foods we picked up both a box of a stevia packet sweetener and a box Truvia packets. The stevia packets gave our tea a bitter, diet-tea taste.  It dissolves quickly but has a very weird taste to it.  So we tried the Truvia next time and it was great.  It tastes just like sugar.  It has no bitter or odd tastes or aftertastes.  It takes a minute or two longer than stevia to dissolve but we noticed that even while it was still disappearing from our glasses the tea already tasted sweet and not grainy.  I'll be ordering much more from Amazon since I can't pick this up at any of my local stores yet.\n",

Not sure what the quality issue is here.  I would still be comfortable with recommending buying but keep you expectations a little sheltered.<br /><br />Initial Review<br /><br />I just started eating this - I have been using the Madhava instead of honey - honey is expensive and seems to be tough on my body - I don't have the same negative reactions using agave.<br /><br />I understand what the recent negative review said about Agave - I suspect some/much is true.  HOWEVER, this agave taste so smooth and buttery - WHAT THE HELL - LIVE HARD AND DIE YOUNG!  I don't even bother putting this on cereal because it is a waste - I just drink it from the bottle to fully enjoy all the taste.<br /><br />Here is the reality - I don't get the same negative effect as I do other sweetners - so whatever it is - there is something different - at least for my body.<br /><br />Other products from Wholesome Sweetners inc. the molassas and honey are FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I have only had one 44 oz bottle - NO quality problem with the product that I have.\n",

Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.

      "I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.\n",

      "This tastes like medicine, especially the grape.  At first I thought ordering online was the only way I was going to be able to get flavors for my shaved ice machine, but after trying this and being disappointed, I went on a mission to find decent flavors.  None of the regular supermarkets near my house carried anything, but I managed to run across a Japanese supermarket (Marukai in West Los Angeles) that sold shaved ice syrup.  They had several flavors (25+, including guava, passion fruit, mango, lime, etc.) and they were much cheaper, only $2.50 to $2.99 per bottle.  These from Amazon end up being $5/bottle.<br /><br />If you have access to a Japanese supermarket, you might want to check that out first before committing $15 for only 3 flavors.  If you don't have access, well I guess you're SOL.\n",

      "I was reading these reviews and I see many people here spend a lot of time selecting their foods.  The one very odd thing is that many people are eating SOY products even though it has been proven over and over again that Soy products or non fermented soy, are very bad for you.  It has been proven that they even cause you to not be able to properly digest other foods you are eating alongside it let alone the fact that soy by itself is actually bad for you in most incantations.<br /><br />Soy ingredients are almost always bad.  TOFU for example is indigestible for the most part.  Did you know there is strong evidence showing that soy leads to Alzheimer's disease.  What a horror to learn this.  It is the GMO created soy by Monsanto that does this and of course they deny it all.  They create poison and companies keep buying it because the government was paid off to put their stamp on it and stamp it they do even though it has been proven that it is poison.  NICE RIGHT?<br /><br />Here Read this great article.  Alzheimer's caused by Soy product<br /><br />Here is a great link<br />[...]<br /><br />Read the link as it explains it best.  Basically pure Soybeans contain tons of protein but unless fermented it is inaccessible to us.  I eat lots of MISO which is soy based and it is excellent for you.  I love 3 year old Miso from South River a US based ancient method maker of Miso and genuine Tamari.<br /><br />So just be very very careful before jumping into any of these products.  I also love HEMP but I know nothing about the feasibility of eating it to get the protein from it.  Does hemp also have properties similar to soy in that the protein is difficult to access easily?  NO seems to be the answer.  Hemp is very safe and is the number one plant based protein.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The list from that link for good sources of protein<br /><br />Quality plant-based proteins include:<br /><br />  * Hemp protein (one of the most complete amino acid profiles of any plant-based protein)<br />  * Yellow pea protein<br />  * Brown rice protein<br />  * Flaxseed (also high in Omega-3s)<br />  * Chlorella (a microscopic, freshwater green algae from Japan - my favourite is Chloressence)<br />  * Almonds, other nuts and seeds (preferably sprouted, since sprouting pre-digests the proteins in seeds, making the amino acids more available to your body)<br />  * Legumes<br />  * Pseudograins (including quinoa and buckwheat)<br /><br />GOOD LUCK\n",

Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.

I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.

      "I've been a runner for many years, and I simply can't eat before exercising.  Because of this, I've come to rely on gels to keep me going during a long race.  I've tried various flavors of just about every brand out there.<br /><br />Over the past year or so I've been trying harder to eat more 'natural' foods.  It's not an obsession, just substitutions where possible.  I didn't think that energy gel was something I would be able to find in a natural form, but a friend pointed me to Honey Stingers.<br /><br />Honey Stingers are about as close as you can get, honey with just a few necessary additives.  Personally I love honey, so these taste amazing to me. I would take the 'gold' flavor over other energy gels anytime.  The 'ginsing' was also tasty, though I can't really describe the exact flavor.  I prefer the gold, though, because it doesn't have caffeine.<br /><br />I found these to be easy to eat, only slightly thicker than GU gels.  I chase with water, but I didn't necessarily need to.  I didn't run into any problems with the honey crystallizing or anything else like that.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving these a try, even if you're not looking for 'all natural.'  If you like honey you'll love these, and they're only slightly more expensive than other gels (actually cheaper than some brands).  Don't try something new on race day, but grab a few of these for a training run and you might end up hooked like me.\n",

It loses its flavor within two minutes. That's not an exaggeration - you get literally two minutes of chewing pleasure. The main reason I prefer it to peppermint is that at least the spearmint goes tasteless, while the peppermint turns bitter.<br /><br />On the bright side, the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth two stars despite the lack of flavor.\n",

It's got a nice, smooth, clean citrus flavor that just makes you want to sip on this stuff all day. I LOVE it!! You'll be done with the 8.4 oz can before you know it and wishing you had more to sip on (my only complaint).<br /><br />Secondly, once consumed, the drink gives me almost an immediate mental edge bordering on a comparison between DVD to BluRay quality (for all you TV enthusiasts out there). It's not some huge \"rush\", but slight and enough for you to feel like you just got a great 8 hrs of consistent sleep. If I had to describe it in 2 words, it would be like a \"Brain Refresh\".<br /><br />With that being said, Brain Toniq is NOT going to give you a surge of energy, nor is it going to speed your brain up to the point where it turns you into a complete \"tweeker\". It is nice and steady with no burnout.<br />Brain Toniq is also not going to keep you up when you have 3 hrs of sleep and are looking to stay up for a longer period of time. It may help a little, but I have personally found that if I'm very tired (lacking much sleep) then I can fall asleep on this stuff. What it DOES do is improve your mental focus and thought process a bit when you may be suffering from \"brain fog\".<br /><br />I wouldn't really classify it as an energy drink, so if you purchase this under that assumption, then you'll be sadly disapointed. Brain Toniq doesn't even mention the words \"energy drink\" on their can and I truly believe they don't want you to think of them as one. Their labeled the \"organic think drink\" and that is exactly what it is. If your looking for a refreshing drink to give you a nice little mental boost through out the day, then this is the drink for you.<br /><br />TIP: If you'd like an extra \"turbo boost\" of mental and physical energy that's 100% natural to combine with Brain Toniq, try Panax Ginseng pills/shots. This will give you that added benefit of energy and mental power.\n",

      "This wonderful organic granola has become my favorite granola. It is just perfectly crunchy and goes well with milk or can be sprinkled on top of yogurt. I like the crunchiness of the pumpkin seeds and they mix well with the oats and flax seeds. This is sweetened with evaporated cane juice instead of regular sugar or corn syrup. It is also high in fiber, low in sodium and has six grams of protein per serving. Give it a try I think you'll love it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "In order to get some valid feedback, I offered this new sauce to four teenage boys who love eating at Taco Bell.  Not one of them liked it. Their comments ranged from \"Too smoky\", \"Tastes like French dressing that went bad\" to \"It leaves an aftertaste\". I was quite surprised by their responses. In order to fairly evaluate the product, I added it to my own turkey and cheese sandwich wrap. (It is not a low-cal condiment.) I'm sorry to say...I agree wholeheartedly with the boys. Perhaps this product is better suited for just tacos and not sandwiches or salads. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this product.\n",

      "These are my favorite. 3 have like 70 calories. I had them while on the Medifast program and still lost 60 lbs. Now they are a big part of my maintenance plan. I was happy to see that I can buy them separately without having to order the mixed pack. Don't get me wrong, they are all good  but the MANGO TANGO is the best one for me. But I dislike the sour ones, and of course, I got tons of with the mixed pack I ordered before. So even though these cost a little more,  they are a better deal since I don't waste any. Also, with the mixed package (5LB) you never know what you end up getting. I read reviews of people complaining that they got only a few ones of particular flavors and a bunch of others, while in my order I got different amounts that they did. so there is still no consistency in the mixed packages even though they keep saying they are fixing that to make them more even. One particular thing, the last order have one bag with a bunch of empty wrappers, some witht he sticks in them but no lollipop, I reported it to Amazon.\n",

I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.\n",

Find out what your cat is allergic to and don't feed it as much! If you are free-feeding, your cat will gain weight because it can eat whenever it wants. Also, as cats age, they gain weight easier just like people do. It's not the food's fault.\n",

      "We bought ours just before Christmas and plugged it in on December 27.  The chives and basils sprouted after just 3 days and we've seen visible growth in the few hours from when we come home from work to when we go to bed.  Seven days into the project and we're seeing signs of life in the \"Sprouts in 8-14 days\" pods.<br /><br />The documentation is excellent.  It has simple clear diagrams and easy to follow language.  And the instructions appear in multiple places, so you don't have to worry about losing the manual.<br /><br />We bought the white model retail for the same price before tax and it came with a $20 mail-in rebate, but you had to buy two to get the deal.\n",

      "1 star for the vendor - read below. 5 stars for the product. Spent some time in Thailand and picked some of these up for about 50 cents a pack. Yeah, they're cheap in Thailand. What we did was use a packet of this with a pound of ground chicken. We crisped up some bacon and put the bacon and seasoned browned chicken over hot rice. The seasoning is extremely spicy, but we couldn't stop eating it. I brought some back with me but somehow they didn't make it so I assume they were stolen by some fat airport security somewhere along the way.<br /><br />I was excited to see these on Amazon but can't recommend the newbie vendor Veryhug. They canceled my order even though the item is in stock. At the time they were offering free shipping. When I came back after my order was canceled, they're charging for shipping. As of now, their price is still low comparatively, but out of principle I won't be buying from them. Instead, I found a decent deal on Ebay from an established, international seller with 100% feedback. I think I'll get better service that way.\n",

      "My dog is 12, and has had constantly firm stool his whole life.  After a dental surgery, I used these, and assume the medicine was giving him diarrhea.  After he was better, and no more pills... I was still using these leftover pockets to smear into an old hollow bone (they are very pliable and many are cracked and smoooooshed, already, prior to opening the package), and he continued to have diarrhea.  I was just worried something happened due to the mediciation, but finally put two and two together.  Googling these pill pockets, diarrhea is a side effect.  So be aware.  These work well for the pill part, but the drawbacks are there too.<br /><br />Also, I haven't talked about diarrhea this much in my whole life.  I have heard the only time it's good to have diarrhea is in scrabble, because it's worth a crapload of points. I saw someone on Twitter ask Greenies if Diarrhea was a side effect.. the question is hilarious: [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo... we love our dogs.  We hate messy poop.  There may be better ways.

      "I wish I could buy these on subscription like other groceries on Amazon.  I start getting nervous when we get low on this stuff.  The moment I touch the bag, my two cats and two dogs line up in a row and wait in eager anticipation for treat time. When we are out of them they all just wander around the kitchen scowling at me.  By a long shot, this is everybody's favorite treat.  And I love the fact that there's nothing else in these except chicken.  I know this product is designed to be sprinkled on top of food and when we get down to the bottom of the bag we use them for that, but for small dogs and cats, these make a great treat.  A big dog would probably devour the whole bag in a matter of minutes so I wouldn't bother for big dogs unless you wanted to use them as a training treat.  The chunks are small, but for my chihuahuas and cats they are practically a meal.<br /><br />If they seem pricey for the amount you get, remember that dehydration removes the water and without the water meat weighs about 1/4 of what it weighed when fully hydrated.  These aren't cheap by any measure, but they aren't ridiculously expensive either when you consider that one 4oz bag is made from about a pound of meat and unlike most treats they aren't packed with fillers.\n",

      "It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.\n",

      "I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.\n",

      "I am never without Darjeeling tea. It is a nice mild tea that tastes good both hot and iced. I am new to loose tea so was a little surprised when I opened the first can to find such fine particles, similar to what you find inside a tea bag. I assumed all loose tea was of the larger, full leaf type. Had I read the other reviews here, I would have known better so my bad.<br /><br />My only complaint about this purchase - hence the 4 star rating - is the expiration date on the tins. They shipped February 8, 2010, with an expiration date of May 28, 2010. Under 4 months? In airtight containers, I expect tea to last at least a year. I understand they have to rotate their stock and these tins had probably been sitting around for 6 months, but it was still surprising and disappointing. As an avid tea drinker, I just finished the last tin so I only went about one month past the expiration date but still, they need to plan their inventory better.<br /><br />If you have yet to try Darjeeling tea, I highly recommend it. Twinings is a good and reputable brand and the quality and flavor never disappoints.\n",

      "I buy this soda because it is organic. Every ingredient is as safe as it can be. Organic sugar as the sweetener. Caramel coloring and tartaric acid, as opposed to phosphoric acid, that are derived naturally from the sugar and acid in grapes. Of course the cola flavoring is also organic. These days nearly every drink available at any given gas station is so loaded with toxins/carcinogens it's really actually not funny. So it's nice to have a truly delicious alternative that quite EASILY stands up to the flavor of Poopsi or Coo-Cooo Cola. I am ashamed I grew up drinking Coo-Coo cola, no really. They know darn well what they put into their drinks and they know it's not natural. If there is any shadow of a doubt about a chemical, why in the world would you still use it citing lack of evidence as reason for your continued use of artificial caramel coloring? If someone wants to smoke pot or ingest these ridiculous designer smokes, example K2, the government then tells you that you can not ingest/sell/buy that citing lack of suppporting evidence as the reason for your denial of anyone's human rights. All this is why I'm willing to spend a few extra dollars on a delicious cola that is made with non-toxic ingredients. Thank you Blue Sky and thank you Amazon for selling this tasty drink. It's a much better deal than buying it at the health food store.\n",

      "Hodgson Mill has different types of couscous and they are all fairly delicious. This one has the added advantage of being whole wheat and has flaxseed mixed in, hopefully lowering its glycemic index and making it richer in essential fatty acids. I haven't actually compared the nutritional profile with regular couscous.<br /><br />The best thing about couscous is the easy cooking- simply boil water in the microwave, add couscous and salt, cover and wait for 5 minutes. Done! Then you can dress it up. My favorite recipe is sauteeing some whole spices (cumin, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon) along with sliced almonds and raisins and mixing in the couscous, along with a chopped preserved lemon. Serve with grilled vegetables (any kind of squash- winter/summer works well).<br /><br />[...]\n",

      "I tried two flavors of these Izze cans - Clementine and Pomegranate.<br /><br />What I like: Real juice - no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. Better for you than a soda. The smaller serving size is just right and the can is a comfortable shape to hold. I liked both of these flavors, with the Pomegranate coming out slightly ahead. Both were a nice mix of tart and sweet. They also make great vodka mixers.<br /><br />What could be better: These really need to be cold to be at their best in flavor and fizz. I often prefer drinks to be room-temp because my teeth can be cold-sensitive. If you're looking for a fizz fix, then there are flavored, unsweetened sparkling waters out there that would satisfy without any calories at all.<br /><br />Miscellaneous notes: As others have said before, be aware that the flavor juice is not necessarily the main juice (pomegranate), or even present at all (clementine). They're not a complete source of the fortified vitamins, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />It all comes down to what you're looking for. Looking for a sparkling juice that's relatively good for you? This is an excellent and recommended answer.\n",

      "This is one way to make the change from diary use. I've tried soy milk, almond milk,rice milk and oat milk (I really like the oat milk for non coffee uses). Hemp milk won out for use in my coffee. I used to drink a gallon and a half of 1% organic milk per week. I now use 1/2 to 3/4's of a gallon per week, so quite an improvement. I've also used this to make hot chocolate. If you really want an enjoyable alternative for hot chocolate milk, try chocolate hazelnut milk-very satisfying, but high calorie. What I like most about the hemp milk is there is no noticeable difference to my palate or visually when used in coffee. The down side is the cost compared to organic milk, although I use the subscribe and save. I've also purchased the hemp seeds which taste close to a sunflower seed and the hemp oil which also has a nutty taste. I watched the Hemp Revolution documentary. I learned this is an incredible multiple use sustainable plant that basically has no waste and is healthy for the environment and financially rewarding for the farmer. As an aside here is a quote from Jefferson. \"Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth & protection of the country.\" -Thomas Jefferson (due to use in making rope, paper and ship sails of canvas).\n",

I would like to think that it is because it is organic, but not all organic coffees taste this smooth.  So that leads me to believe that it is because it is water processed.  I will have to try another water processed coffee before I can truly say that is why.<br /><br />My husband on the other hand does not love this coffee.  He really likes D&D's, which I detest.  He also enjoys good ole Folgers.  I think it is a difference in taste buds, as we prefer different amounts of \"flavor\" (aka salt) on our foods.<br /><br />Because of our differences of opinion, I give this coffee an avg. of 4 stars: 5 from me, and 3 from him.\n",

      "This is a condensed soup and comes out of the can as an alarmingly orange gelatinous blob!  Cooked with half and half and a touch of sherry it becomes a tasty pink-colored lobster bisque.  The lobster meat is definitely pureed into the soup (you can taste the occasional fleck of lobster in this).  If you like your bisque chunkier you might want to consider adding some diced lobster meat, crawfish tail meat or chopped shrimp to the soup for a heartier experience.  A dash of brandy would also be a good addition.  I haven't tried the Chincoteague brand bisque.  From the picture on the can it looks like a white, rather than pink, bisque.  From its reviews the Chincoteague sounds like it has more lobster meat in it than this brand does and is more assertively seasoned.  The Chincoteague could be made pink by the addition of a little tomato paste or sweet paprika.  I'll be curious to try it and compare the two brands.\n",

      "THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWER'S YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING \"REAL BREWER'S YEAST\" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This \"Genuine Brewer's Yeast\" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

      "We've been enjoying McCormick's crock-pot chilli for some time now so I thought why not try this newest recipe. Of course it's simple: chicken ( I use thighs with skin removed ), a couple cans of stewed tomatoes ( plain is good, Italian better ), can of tomato paste and a half pound of sliced mushrooms. That's it. I put these ingredients in my slow cooker around noon time. A while later ( 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low per the instructions ) it's ready. It can be eaten as is or, as we do, put on top of spaghetti. Sometimes to make it even more like spaghetti sauce I'll add a can of marinara ( Hunt's works well ) which is just the right touch and stretches the sauce base.<br /><br />  This dish isn't what you'd call 'gourmet' but when time is an issue using this mix will definitely make life easier. The only down side to using thighs I find is pulling out the bones and other things not wanted. But thighs are inexpensive and tasty. I've also used chicken breast sliced into long strips which is better if you have young ones who just want to dive in and can't watch for those unwanted items.<br /><br />  Along with the chilli mix and the beef stew mix ( both get eaten very quickly around here ) the Italian Herb mix is a good kitchen tool to have when a wholesome, quick meal is called for. It's easily modified to taste and keeps you coming back for more. And buying these mixes from Amazon in bulk packs almost cuts the cost in half compared to individual packs bought at large food stores. Can't beat that!\n",

      "I've tried to write this review three times now, and every time I get a power blip or something happens to the browser and I lose it.  One more time.<br /><br />I made this carefully, and it is not tasty.  It has a big packet of spices that has a lot of whey, onion, and cheese and spices like black pepper are lower than an ingredient that is listed as \"not more than 2%.<br /><br />I've eaten tasty mac and cheese, and I've even eaten decent hamburger helper, like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ59EQ\">Hamburger Helper, Cheesy Nacho, 7.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  That stuff is cheaper and tastes better.<br /><br />This stuff is easy to make.  You brown one pound of beef (I weighed it to be sure I was following directions) and then drain it (pouring out the tasty juices, I won't do that again), then add the misnamed seasoning packet and the pasta, along with two cups of water.<br /><br />Bring it to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 11-13 minutes.<br /><br />Then remove from the heat and mix in the velveeta packet.<br /><br />They suggest that you add lettuce?  Or chopped tomatoes, so I added Ro-Tel to part of it - the other part I kept pristine so that I could taste it as made.  I used hot Ro-Tel, and, other than the flavor of the Ro-Tel it was bland.  I have to think that the pasta is sort of bland and the spicing in the packet is lacking.  It could have some more onion flavor, or more than 0.5% garlic or something.<br /><br />The value in this is what I believe to be parboiled pasta that can be cooked in this fashion.<br /><br />The net weight of this stuff is 12.8 ounces - with a pound of beef, it makes 5 one cup servings.  My wife guesses that it serves three adults, or six-eight toddlers (if you were making lunch for a day care, say).<br /><br />Now, this is my suggestion:<br /><br />Suppose you buy a piece of velveeta in the store, some cream, some beef, and a little garlic powder, some onion powder, and some pasta.<br /><br />Cook a quarter pound of pasta in one pan, boiling and draining normally, and then brown a pound or two of beef with a bunch of onion and garlic powder, to taste.  In a third pan (or in the one you boiled the pasta in), grate or cube about a pound of Velveeta and heat it gently with a 2 tbsp of butter, stirring frequently until melted, then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream a little at a time while stirring. Add a little white pepper and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, if you like it. Or use sour cream instead of whole cream, or put a little beef broth into the beef after it has browned.<br /><br />Now combine the cheese sauce, the pasta (use more or less to taste, the beef (please don't drain it unless you are on a low fat diet, and then do so carefully - if you have one of those old fat brushes, use that, try to save the juices).  Then add a whole can of Ro-Tel, to your family's taste, hot, mild, lime-chili, whatever.  Taste it - and if it is bland, fix it.<br /><br />Dust the top with paprika before serving it.<br /><br />This dish will taste good, and it won't take you much longer to make it than it would to start with this mix.  And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.<br /><br />Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.  And there is nothing wrong with this stuff except that it is just tasteless, and almost anyone can do better.  Seriously, YOU can do better than this bland product.  If you like Velveeta, use it. If you don't like Velveeta, well, making it yourself allows you to make your cheese sauce from a different type of cheese.  Mexican melting cheese is good.  Heck, Sargento six cheese is great.<br /><br />If you don't want to do it yourself, save money and buy Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I can't rate this less than 3 stars, far as I can tell, it is wholesome and it doesn't actively taste bad. It doesn't actively taste of much at all.  So it gets three stars, and a suggestion that you can do so much better by doing it yourself that you should try.<br /><br />If I had some of this stuff I had to use, I'd:<br /><br />Add a half tsp of white pepper, a half tsp of paprika, garlic powder to taste and onion powder to taste.  I might consider a knorr garlic cube.  Or Chipotle.  I would always add the Ro-Tel, this is the biggest fix you can make to this stuff. Paprika to dust the top before serving.  And, well, beef broth instead of water - that \"seasoning\" is really, really bland. A dollop of sour cream when you put the cheese sauce in, and a tablespoon of butter.<br /><br />Because as shipped, it is horribly bland.\n",

      "**Former Child Star Thumper Meets Tragic End**<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.<br /><br />Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward \"Eddie\" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.<br /><br />\"Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?\"  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. \"If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!\" and \"Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?\"<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed \"Thumper\" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. \"If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!\" formed the basis of what is now known as \"The Thumperian Principle\" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, \"Suck My Carrot\", \"Young Bunny Coed Love\", and finally, \"The Bunny Hole\".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the \"Shake A Leg Foundation\" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.\n",

      "I tried a few dry food brands after the pet food recall of 2007.  I tried some grain free, and noticed some problems from the cats.  I tried going all wet - but apparently - my 17 yo needs some of the grains in dry food,  Their main food of choice (I'm not much of one for switching - had trouble with Turkey and Salmon flavors) is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0\">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>.<br /><br />I started with this Dry when it was Eagle Pack Holistic Select.  The formula was EU certified (which has a higher degree of ingredient integrity than US pet foods).  Since then, this company merged with the new owners of Wellness - so the 2 brands can compliment each other.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />EDIT: 3/24/2011<br />I've switched some things up since the Wellness problems (and still waiting for Wellness Chicken Recipe to Return).<br /><br />I have started rotation feeding wet food, and have found that I use less dry food than before - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY\">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).  For saving Vet Bills - it pays to have kitties on a high quality diet.<br /><br />PS - the bag comes with its own zip lock closure, I've never had a problem with spoilage nor a-toxins.<br />PPS - some have found this a good rotation ONLY, it eases the budget: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6\">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.\n",
