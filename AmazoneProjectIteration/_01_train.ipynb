      "October 8, 2010. The Blue Buffalo Company of Wilton, Connecticut has announced a dog food recall of certain batches of some of its popular products due to potentially toxic levels of vitamin D.<br /><br />My dog got extremely sick, and was very upset to hear of this.  Only thing that changed with his diet/life was blue buffalo.  I literally almost lost my dog last week and had to have in surgery because his gallbladder was about to explode.  He quit eating completely, was throwing up, diarrhea, and took him to the vet to realize his liver was swollen and gallbladder had to come out.  It's sad to think you pay good money for dog food and you still could be feeding him poison.  I don't know how I will every trust dog food products anymore.  Please make sure there is no recalls on food you are feeding your dog.\n",

      "For those on a totally salt free diet, this is probably the best tasting canned salmon. In my opinion, wild caught and natural is far superior to farm-raised.<br />For those on a reduced sodium diet this salmon is also ideal, because we can add salt to suit ourselves.<br />Don't discard the oil. That is where the wonderful doctor-recommended Omega-3's are contained.<br />Each can is sufficient to make two hefty sandwiches. I like to mix in two tablespoons of quick oats (to absorb the oil); some chopped onion; my favorite condiments and spices; and a bit of Redmond Real Salt (available at Amazon). Let rest a few minutes, and then spread it over whole wheat toast, or into tortillas or pita.<br />Great Stuff!\n",

They also offer a full line of Dr. Brown's sodas, and this one is unbelieveably delicious and goes incredibly well with corned beef on rye. No aftertaste and the black cherry flavor is sweet and unique. Makes you want to turn away from diet coke forever. Good in the can but even better ice cold in the bottle.\n",

      "****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: \"Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing. Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.\"<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****\n",

      "2200 Calories of Tasty Zero Calorie Artificial Sweetener<br /><br />Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated.<br /><br />I like the taste, after taste and texture of this product.  I love sweets, but I am working on losing weight.  I exercise every day, but that is not enough.  I had been adding a lot of granulated Splenda (and the granulated generic sucralose sweetener) to my diet drinks, fruit, juice and almost everything. It says zero calories, so a big time sugar junkie like me should be able to eat just as much or more than the amount of sugar that I would have eaten and still lose weight.  But it was no calories, so I used even more.  Suddenly my whole world was sweet.<br /><br />But I was gaining weight and it didn't add up.  So I looked at the bag and written on there was that the product was a source of minimal calories.  I looked up sucralose and went to the Splenda web site.  There it explained that legally, if a serving has less than 5 calories then they are entitled to call it zero calories.  But the vendor decides how much is in a serving.  If you make the serving size small enough, any food can be labeled zero calorie (that's an industry serving regulation if I ever heard of one).  Splenda says the serving size is 1 teaspoon and as long as it has less than 5 calories they can call it zero calories.  Sucralose by itself really does have nearly zero calories in any amount I would use.  But I was still gaining weight<br /><br />So I looked at that bag again.  The numbers just were not adding up.  What else is in there; it sure isn't pure sucralose or there would be a lot less product in the bag.  Well, the filler is malto dextrin.  This is a safe well known sugar that has been in food products for decades.  It has calories, but not as much as table sugar.  It's about 1/8 of the calories of regular table sugar.  That is a significant reduction.  But it is not zero.  If you are using it for baking, you use a whole lot more than one teaspoon.  The bag really ought to have the calories per cup, for those who wish to use the product for sugar replacement in baking and cooking.<br /><br />I was using so much Splenda that I was adding an extra 500 calories a day.  This 1.2 pound bag has about 2200 calories.  I've switch over to pure liquid sucralose.  It's not the same and my body missed the real sugar in the mix, but I'm getting used to it.\n",

      "I was shopping at my local drug store late one Saturday night and I stumbled across this brand of animal crackers. I've tried Barnum and Keebler before but not this brand so I wanted to get it. These Stauffer's Animal Crackers are a lighter version of both the Barnum and Keebler. They have less fat and calories and taste more like a cracker whereas the other 2 are more like cookies. So I guess you can eat more of these without feeling as guilty. One aspect of these Animal Crackers that really stood out for me is that they have amazing shelf life. The package I bought is not the same as this one on Amazon - it more resembled a potato chip package. So I opened it and ate some and then closed it with a clip and then I forgot about it for a while. It must have been sitting there for about 2 months before I remembered I had it. So I tried it and it was as good and as fresh as new. I was amazed. Would definitely buy these again.\n",

      "Good quality canned albacore tuna has very little fishy taste or smell.  Sadly, Chicken of the Sea is not a good quality albacore tuna.<br /><br />These days, I buy albacore because \"regular\" canned tuna smells so strong,it makes me want to gag. (Think cheap cat food.)  It tastes too fishy, and is filled with less than desirable pieces. (Skin, etc.) Albacore contains \"cleaner\" meat chunks and I rarely ever see any bad bits in the can. It's paler in color and has a much more desirable flavor.<br /><br />Growing up, my Mom always bought \"regular\" tuna, (as opposed to albacore) and I never remember it smelling as strong as \"regular\" tuna does now. I've tried many different brands, and I've finally realized that I have to move to the pricier albacore for a better \"tuna\" experience.<br /><br />This Chicken of the Sea Albacore is very watery, (more to drain off) and the consistency in the can is \"loose.\" (As opposed to \"chunky\") It seems more processed than other brands. It has a stronger odor and taste than I prefer, and this will keep me from buying it again.\n",

      "I bought a bag of this stuff just for kicks. I like Cream of Rice and usually make it with a little butter and salt. I had no idea what Teff would taste like, but it is fantastic, it really is! Kind of like a nutty Cream of Rice but with a very nice consistency. I am definitely a converted Teff eater!<br /><br />I followed the directions on the bag: boil 2 cups of lightly salted water, then add 1/2 cup of Teff. It says to cover and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. The first time I made it, the Teff was all over the inside of the pot and cover. So it needs to be on a very low simmer. I find that it works best to cook it like they say but stir it around 2-3 times during the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />UPDATE: By the way, if you cook it the entire time with the cover on like the directions say, the water won't evaporate. I remove the cover about half-way through. I set the kitchen timer for 5 minute intervals and simmer the Teff, then come back and stir it. After 10 minutes, I leave the cover off, otherwise the water won't evaporate and it will be too watery.<br /><br />If you don't use a low simmer, it will stick to the sides of the pot so you have to stir it to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom.<br /><br />It takes around 17-18 minutes, it has the consistency of a bit loose Cream of Rice or oatmeal in terms of how much water stays in. I turn off the heat and keep stirring until it stops bubbling, then put it in a bowl.<br /><br />Note: The portion size above and on the instructions yields a huge bowl of the stuff, definitely two big servings. Cut the ingredients in half for one serving. Also, don't over-salt it, it seems to carry the salt taste pretty well.<br /><br />I mix about a 1/4 teaspoon of butter and a bit more salt to taste and it is really delicious, it really is. Definitely recommended. Although it is a bit expensive. But it's good! In fact, I'd say it's probably the best hot breakfast cereal I ever ate -- except I eat it all the time, for a snack!<br /><br />It gets 5 stars as a food, but I dropped a star because it is a bit fussy to cook. But if I can do it, anyone can!\n",

      "I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. I have learned that some products are made in the US, but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol, which they themselves confirmed was made in China.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.  This was as a result of a legitimate concern.<br />-I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked. I was therefore worried about all of them.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.\n",

      "Okay so I ordered every flavor of these during the summer sale in June were most of the flavors $12, and if you signed up \"Subscribe and Save\" they were $10.50 each.  So, I will be putting up reviews as I open each box.  They have been in the fridge (keeps me from random snacking) and I opened Dark Chocolate, Chocolate Mudslide, and Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate last night.  I am 5'3\" and 118 and I try to add some protein to my diet with bars like this.  My review will only be for the Mixed Nuts & White Chocolate (others on the appropriate product pages.)  I will start with what EVERYONE really cares about: TASTE!  These bar tasted incredible to me!!!! Nutty, sweet, light, creamy white chocolate, chewy consistency, NO chemical taste, sweet but not too sweet. I read the nutrient profile and the ingredient list, and I am really pleased with the ingredient quality.  This is what attracted me to the product.  It is very low sugar, gluten free, and wheat free.  This is great for those watching their waistline.  On the other hand, it has a pretty sizeable fat content.  This one has 12(!!!) grams of fat.  So just be aware of that when including in your diet, too many of these and you WILL gain weight!  The protein is okay (10 grams), as much as 1.5 oz of grilled chicken.  (Although chicken breast doesn't have this much fat, and that's not enough chicken to fill anyone up.)  The sodium isn't bad (110 mg).  There are 8 net carbs, which subtract out the fiber and sugar alcohols (the sugar alcohols are in debate as to whether your body burns them as calories or not.)  The calories, fat, protein, and carbs are equal to: a large plain green salad, 1.5 oz chicken breast, 2 cups broccoli, almost a full tablespoon of oil.  So I say that to illustrate that this is definitely a healthy MEAL REPLACEMENT for those on the go (if you add veggies and soup) and really has TOO MANY calories for a full bar to be a snack. It also doesn't have enough heaviness/volume in your stomach to make you feel full for four hours until your next meal.  It is kind a lightweight bar compared to thinkTHIN's regular 20gram protein bars (Read my review for Dark Chocolate and Chocolate Mudslide, those have a preferable nutrient profile for a meal replacement.)  I don't really think any bar that has more fat than protein is helpful, people will still be hungry and gain weight. They do not really have enough protein to eat as a meal replacement because you will be hungry in less than four hours after eating.  If you do use as a meal replacement, add a broth soup and a large green salad with low-cal dressing, or veggies (most grocery stores sell washed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots that you can eat on the go.)  Another way to incorporate these DELICIOUS bars into your routine is a breakfast.  Perfect for on the go and it's hard to eat more before lunch even if you do get hungry (which most people don't get very hungry before lunch.)  So in summary: EXCELLENT ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS; DELICIOUS, SWEET NUTTY FLAVOR WITH CREAMY WHITE CHOCOLATE (as good as a candy bar); CONVENIENT PACKAGING; WEAK VITAMIN & MINERAL PROFILE (you'll still need a comprehensive multivitamin daily); CONVENIENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN; GREAT SNACK (if you eat half as a snack or the other half later in the day as a snack.)  THE PRICE IS RIGHT too based on Amazon's deal vs. in store pricing on these bars.  They are very expensive in retail stores, Amazon is selling them almost 50% off.  Helpful hint: if you sign up for Subscribe & Save, you get the best price.  You can set your shipments to every six months, and even if you don't want them then, you can delay shipment.  The point is, you really never have to buy more later in order to get the best price now.  You can keep deferring shipment.  Not saying that to scam Amazon, just saying that may help more people be willing to try a delicious bar if the price is right.  I hope this review helped you make a purchasing decision, either for or against the product.  I know I hate to waste my money, and I wanted to give a honest review.\n",
