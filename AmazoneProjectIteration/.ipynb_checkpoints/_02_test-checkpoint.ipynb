      "I received Aerogarden half weeks ago thrilled it. The reason I given stars I think expensive, particularly seed kits. I hope popularity grows price come down. At weeks seed pods sprouted. They expected sprout different times indicated seed pods sprouted schedule earlier. I'm new reviewing like upload picture sure possible.<br /><br /> The set ridiculously easy I recommend read instructions things certain order needed. Also supposed seed pods specific order (as box) I didn't read took separate seed kit box didn't know order in. I think likely error list order inserted enclosed box avoid problem. I guessed order growing well.<br /><br />After set add water nutrients future machine tells flashing lights. Couldn't easier!! The instruction booklet short ( nice don't like reading instructions :) The confusing adding nutrients. The instruction book refers tablets/pellets receive plastic tubes liquid don't add tubes instruction says add tablets. Just ensure read nutrient info instruction book seed pod box guidance ignore master instruction book. Also add nutrients depending 3 6 7 pod gardens read carefully.<br /><br />The light super bright. You don't want sleeping. I kitchen I sided board night ( small version kids use science faires exhibits block light seeps bedroom nearby. Herbs 7 8 hours day lights I set timer turn lights 11 PM automatically come 8 hours later. This fabulous feature super easy operate.<br /><br />The pump quiet I didn't think working.<br /><br />So I like lower price I HIGHLY recommend product can't wait enjoy herbs 2 half weeks ready start harvesting<br /><br />UPDATE weeks bulbs died. I contacted customer service immediately said send replacement. I disapointed week confirmed shipped shipped new bulbs currently working herbs continued grow I basil I harvest some.\n",
