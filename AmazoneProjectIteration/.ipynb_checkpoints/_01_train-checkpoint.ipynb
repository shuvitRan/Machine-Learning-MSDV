      "Rooibos tea is great for healing skin conditions but it's also great for your mental health.  I'm always so nervous and anxious and chamomille tea is not as great tasting and calming to me as rooibos tea.  The great thing about this tea is that you can benefit from this wonderful medicinal herb without it tasting like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula.  I used to drink Twinings blackcurrant tea regularly until they changed the formula to something bitter & stronger with the strange yucky tasting floral herbal components.  Then I switched to rooibos tea because of the health/taste benefits and found Twinings to be the cheapest locally.  I buy mine at my local Walgreen's for the cheapest local price, but it looks like you get a more bargain deal here on Amazon.  It tastes like mellow nutty hay and you don't really need much sweetener to sweeten it up.  Double your health benefits by adding raw organic honey.  The longer you steep it, the more the herb tea will seep out its benefits.  I've heard bathing in it regularly will heal skin conditions.

      "Normally I buy Appel (imported) or Trader Joe's brand tinned herring, but was looking for a variety without canola oil and stumbled upon these on Amazon.  Upon ordering these, I had a tin right after I received them.  The price is right - the other varieties I was buying were slightly more expensive and usually there were few in stock at the store - maybe 1-4 cans only.  The Bar Harbor herring is great - no canola oil, tin is easy to open, and the fish is just the right texture and taste - not too smoky, not too overpowering.  These are great and I'll definitely be reordering!\n",

      "Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of \"Greenies\" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as \"source of vitamin k activity.\"<br /><br />Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful.\n",

      "****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****\n",

      "This Green Mountain Flavor Sampler is a great item to have on hand when you're entertaining a large group of friends.  It also makes a nice host or hostess gift when visiting someone who has a Keurig coffee brewer.  Of the four varieties included, three of them rank among my personal all-time favorite K-cups.  Rain Forest Nut is a deliciously smooth medium blend with no bitter undertone whatsoever.  The Wild Mountain Blueberry tastes exactly as you might imagine: full-bodied and sweet, with a satisfyingly tangy aftertaste.  The Vanilla Caramel Creme makes a wonderful dessert coffee: it's rich, smooth, and has an appetizing aroma.  I also enjoy the French Vanilla; it's just not as distinctive as the other three, and tends to be the least seldom chosen the coffee drinkers in my world.<br /><br />Another little tidbit about this Green Mountain Sampler: two of the flavors -- the Rain Forest Nut and the Wild Mountain Blueberry -- are Fair Trade Certified, which simply means that the coffee farmers who grew the beans were paid a living wage for their crops.  I like that concept.  It makes my morning cup of Joe just that much more pleasurable.\n",

This is a better value than many other top-tier dog foods.<br /><br />My dog (a 9-month-old German Shepherd) loves this food.  I transitioned her from the more expensive Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula, and she's doing very well on TOTW after a month.  Her poops are small and easy to clean up.  Her coat is shiny and she has no doggie odor.  She also doesn't scratch much at all.  TOTW is good for allergy-prone dogs because it is grain-free.<br /><br />One benefit of TOTW is that your dog eats less of it per day than other dog foods, thus saving money, because the food is high in protein.  However, it's also rather rich, so be careful when changing to this food to prevent diarrhea.<br /><br />I highly recommend TOTW because it's for all life stages, has proper ingredients for a dog's diet, and is a good value for the price!\n",

      "A few years ago, my cats and I relocated to Germany. And while my four-pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now, several years later, still sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not overly picky in their food choices; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???\n",

      "When I ordered this product, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I kind of had in mind a \"curry ketchup\" (literally just ketchup with a curry aftertaste), but the description made me think that wasn't quite on the mark.  But since I've been happy with Maya Kaimal's other products, and as a lover of both Indian food and ketchup, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />My suspicion that this wouldn't just be \"ketchup plus some curry flavor\" was borne out.  Honestly, it's a little difficult to describe.  It's as though someone scrapped the idea of ketchup and decided to start over and build a new ketchup out of some new ingredients and some old ones.  That's a weird description, I know, so I'll go into a little more detail.  It's just that nearly every ketchup you buy is basically slight variations on a theme.  This is different, but still identifiably ketchup.<br /><br />The spicy ketchup isn't smooth like most ketchups; it has a definite texture to it.  It's very slightly thicker than most ketchups, but not so much that you use it any differently.  It's not as tart as ketchup tends to be, nor as sweet as some (particularly ones that use sugar instead of HFCS).  It has a pleasant tomato flavor with a hint of smokiness and a definite Indian flair.  But all of the flavors are very, very integrated.  Like I said before, this isn't \"ketchup plus.\"  It has a very unified, if complex, flavor.  And for those who are worried about the \"spicy\" part of the name, this ketchup has a little bit of bite to it, about as much heat as a one-star curry.<br /><br />I've tried it on a variety of different foods that I normally eat with ketchup and I admit my success has been mixed.  I tried it first with some fast food french fries, which was decidedly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad; it's just that it was more novel than good.  I tried it later with tater tots, which was much better.  I've had it on an ordinary cheeseburger, which was good but it didn't wow me like it wowed one of my friends.  But the two biggest successes I've had with it have been the most surprising.<br /><br />One, this ketchup is excellent on a hot dog.  Yes, I know you aren't \"supposed\" to put ketchup on hot dogs, but I don't like mustard or relish and I don't always want a chili dog.  And for what it's worth, I think the spicy Indian ketchup actually \"goes with\" hot dogs better than ordinary ketchup (which isn't to say I like it more, per se, just that the flavors seem more complementary).<br /><br />And two, I just tried this ketchup tonight on some black pepper and bleu cheese hamburgers I picked up at the store.  Again, I didn't expect much but tried it on a whim.  Amazing.  The black pepper really brought out the spiciness of the ketchup.  And the pockets of bleu cheese in the burgers... I really did not expect bleu cheese to go well with Indian-themed ketchup, but the combination was just incredible.  A stronger bleu cheese might not work as well, but this was fairly mild.<br /><br />I've tried a few different variant ketchups in the past (did I mention I really like ketchup?), but I rarely find anything that's worth getting again.  Not only am I glad I bought this bottle of spicy Indian ketchup, but when it's gone I plan on buying another.  I still use my Heinz, mind you.  The two ketchups are not interchangeable.  But they do seem to be good on largely the same things, and the spicy Indian ketchup is great for adding just a bit of flair to your food.  Highly recommend.\n",

They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.\n",

It tastes very much like sweetened iced tea, but not too sweet, it has just the right amount of cane sugar to give it a very natural tasting sweetness.  This is not your typical sugared candy, you know typical supermarket candies that overwhelm you with a rush of sugar.  This tea candy is very mild in sweetness compared to other candies.

      "This was my first try with organic dried apples.  I have decided to avoid pesticide ridden fresh and dried apples.  When the package arrived I was a little disturbed at the lack of labeling of any kind.  They were identified as Bare Fruit Fuji Apples packaged for Amazon, with an address for Bare Fruits. Weight one pound. That was it.  No use by date, or any kind of a freshness indicator. No ingredients list, though I assume the ingredients are just apples.  But how can I know for sure?  They came in a sturdy silver mylar type bag, very well padded for shipping.  I haven't come up with a way to reclose the bag for freshness.  Even my vacuum sealer system, which works on most mylar bags will not reseal this one.  My first try at the chips themselves was a little disappointing.  Many of the pieces were almost too small for munching.  The taste and texture was foreign to me.  But then a little later in the day I was surprised that I wanted more.  Maybe taste buds just need a chance to get accustomed to a new thing.  Now I love them. The Fuji taste comes through beautifully,  They are slightly crunchy without being hard straight from the bag.  I have also thrown a handful in in place of other fruit when making oatmeal in the morning.  When added in the last minute or so of cooking, they come out plump and flavorful.  My husband is taking them instead of potato chips with his lunch and finds them to be a satisfying mid afternoon snack. I am now thinking of other ways to try them, both rehydrated and dry.  Maybe in muffins?  Rehydrate in maple syrup to use on pancakes?  Or could I use them as an alternative to peeling and slicing apples for pie?  Two one pound bags is alot of apples, and since I don't know how long they will stay fresh I am ready to explore.\n",

She has dropped weight, her eyes are bright, kitty acne on her chin has cleared, and she acts like a playful kitten again!<br /><br />Other notes about this food:<br />-Core costs more than our previous food (Pet Promise), but they don't scarf it down like the old food.  They get excited and eat for a few minutes any time the bowl is filled, but then they just return to nibble from time to time.  So, a bag of Core lasts longer.  Perhaps this is because they are getting the protein they need without having to eat pounds of food!<br />-This food smells like fish meal, and tends to give them slightly stinky breath, but it is not overpowering.<br />-Small, round kibble is crunchy, but not as hard and dry as most commercial dry foods. Our picky eater had no problem with the transition.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this food.  I'm in awe of the truly priceless health changes we have seen in our cats, and only wish we had made the switch years ago!\n",

      "It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!\n",

      "I'm eating a cup of this soup as I type this. It's handy to have in the office, it keeps me from running out to buy something deep-fried or cream-filled, and it really isn't bad. But it's not my favorite Dr. McDougall's soup. It has a slightly bitter edge that I don't care for, the kind you sometimes get from dried herbs that have been sitting too long (the use-by date is a year from now), and at the same time it seems too sweet. The first thing my wife said about it when she tried hers a few minutes ago was, \"too sweet,\" so it's not just me (and she likes food sweeter than I do). We won't throw the rest of the box away, but I won't be ordering this one again. If I'm going to give up a trip to my favorite bakery to eat soup in my office, I want it to be better than not bad.\n",

The nice thing about this product is that it lacks hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, and dairy products which I have found in some powder mixes and concentrates.

HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (spinach, mango, pears) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with green beans AND peas, you would think the color would be closer to a light green rather than just pear. but in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!\n",

      "I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to \"double brew\" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.\n",

      "I'm usually the type of person to buy whatever is on sale to give to her cats. But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on. (Sometimes I get kinds that literally would be the size for a smallish dog and not a cat. They have problems eating it and the pieces fall everywhere.)<br /><br />I will continue to buy this kind as long as it remains available.\n",

      "Let me start by saying that these are not like regular pasta noodles. There is a specific texture to these that is hard to describe. When you first open the package, there is a fishy smell. The easiest way to deal with this is to dump the bag into a strainer over the sink (hold your nose if fishy smells bother you) and rinse with water for about 30 seconds. Then put the noodles in a bowl of water with vinegar in it (about 3 or 4 cups of water and 1 or 2 tablespoons of vinegar) and let it soak for about 10 minutes. This gets rid of the fishy smell. After I do this I like to split the package in half, put one half in a paper towel-lined container in the fridge, and \"saute\" the other half with a small amount of olive oil. This will replace the \"drying\" that is recommended. Then I add a sauce like spaghetti or curry sauce and eat.<br />I can't say that I really enjoy eating them all that much, BUT replacing my lunchtime meal with these noodles has helped me to lose about 3 pounds already. They really fill you up quickly, and the fiber is very good for you. I did a lot of research before I tried them, because I had heard a lot of bad things about the smell and texture, and after trying them I can say that the benefits outweigh all that. They're really not that bad if you prepare them as above. I would recommend them if you are trying to cut your calories.\n",

      "I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many \"mixed\" reviews. To start: they are NOT \"healthy\". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so \"healthy\" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the \"Classic White Cheddar Cheese\". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following:<br /><br />1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams:<br /><br />Calories: 75<br />Calories from fat: 60<br />Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV])<br />Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV)<br />Sodium - 275mg (12% DV)<br />Total carbs - 1g (0% DV)<br />Protein - 5 g<br />Vitamin A - 5% DV<br />Calcium - 16% DV<br /><br />The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent tasting, low carb, high fat snack. Not something I will eat every day, but a nice \"treat\" when I am in the mood for something salty and crunchy.\n",

      "I have to say that without a doubt this is the very best food I have ever fed my dogs, both were adopted and didn't like any dog food that we gave them. The food would sit all day, and then we would throw it out give them a fresh set and it would sit until (I'm guessing) they were both so hungry they didn't have a choice but to eat it, and this always made me feel sooo bad. I went to the \"natural dog food store\" the owner of the store was amazing and gave me a few free samples of the taste of the wild line of dog food. I was skeptical but went home and fed it to Jasmine and Peanut, my MinPin and Pekinese mix, much to my surprise they licked the bowl clean and have been ever since, they enjoy dinner time now, they have more energy, their coats are so much softer, and they are going to the bathroom on a much more regular basis. I have nothing bad to say about this food, and if you love your babies as much as I love mine, TRY IT! you won't be disappointed.<br />Samantha\n",

      "I bake dozens and dozens of cookies throughout the year, with a huge chunk of that happening at Christmastime.  I recently bought--for the first time--a package of the Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie mix.  Well, I discovered a gold mine!  I compared the ease of adding just a couple of ingredients the package mix, to all that I would have to do, to make up a batch of basic sugar cookies, and realized that I was working just too hard!  From there, I made two different recipes from this wonderful mix.  First, for Orange Cookies, I added a heaping tablespoon of orange zest, 1 1/2 tsp. of orange extract, and 1 cup of Rice Crispies.  I then made 1\" balls of dough and rolled them in orange-colored sugar.  They turned out just great!  For the next recipe--Coconut Cookies--I added 1 cup of shredded coconut and 1 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract, and--voila!--another fantastic recipe.  Both, of course, were made from the Betty Crocker mix, and I challenge anyone to tell me that they could tell the difference between this mix and \"from scratch\" cookies.  I'm now thinking of more ways to embellish my new favorite cookie dough.  The possibilities are endless!\n",

The bar is good for a quick snack if you're hungry between meals, and if you divide your meals up to five a day, then it's basically a meal.  Each bar has 6 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protien, so it will help fill you up more than that junky Snickers.  They're a little on the expensive side, but it's worth it.\n",

Although the ginger is hot,sweet and spicy (and I like that), each piece was difficult to chew. Often, it felt like chewing cud (sorry, too much information I know), but I was literally left with a stringy, wet wad in my mouth after eating each piece. Couldn't even swallow...more like eating ginger gum than candies.<br /><br />I didn't even finish off the entire bag. Ginger candy is one of my favorite candies -- up there with chocolate for me. Not being able to finish off the ginger, tells you something. I only eat this stuff when I'm desperate for something to snack on, and even afterward, ick. There isn't even a calming medicinal effect I usually experience with ginger. It's more of a laxative-like effect than tummy nirvana.<br /><br />I prefer Reed's crystallized ginger and The Ginger People's crystallized ginger candies to this stuff. I wish Amazon would take the picture down. A little truth in advertising please. Put the real picture of ginger chips up to stop confusing the buyer.<br /><br />Sorry, but I will not be buying this again.\n",

When I set her food bowl down, she drools on the floor if I wait even just a few seconds to tell her she can eat. She had never ever done this before, and she started doing it the day I started mixing it into her food and has done it since.<br /><br />Plus, it's great for her. I'm not even halfway through this bag and already her coat is improving! I transitioned slowly from her old food and she has had no negative reactions to it whatsoever. If your dog tolerates this food (all dogs are different of course), you can be confident they will thrive on it.

My favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's: Clearly superior ingredients, the most malt flavor. My husband's favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's Pumpkin:  Very good but not what I expected.

      "I know most people don't like fruitcake, it's a huge joke. And that's fine, I'm cool with that. Nobody said you _have_ to eat fruitcake. I wasn't a fruitcake lover myself until I was an adult.<br />My grandmother always made fruitcake and I wouldn't touch it. My brother had told me that the candied fruit was plastic. Of course, he still ate it. So eventually I tried my grandmother's fruitcake and it was delicious. And I married a man who likes fruitcake, so that began my fruitcake experimentation.<br />Homemade fruitcake is completely different from store bought fruitcake. Store bought fruitcake is dry and has only a smattering of fruit. Obviously, the commercial bakeries do _not_ use the Pennant Fruitcake Mix.<br />This is a great fruitcake mix because it actually has a variety of candied fruit, not just a few pieces of citron or \"mystery fruit\" the \"other\" in the ingredients. The package it is sold in (16 ounces) makes it easy to use with your fruitcake recipe because of what most recipes require. The fruit is tasty, chopped well and believe it or not, inexpensive for this type of thing. Go check the grocery stores if you don't believe me, you'll see what I mean.<br />So if you're planning on making a fruitcake for somebody who deserves it and will appreciate it, I strongly recommend you use the Pennant Fruitcake Mix. Or for that matter, any other recipe that requires candied fruit. This mix will make your baked items delicious and easy to put together.<br />See how much better a fruitcake can be when you make it yourself.\n",

      "Been using this for 3 weeks now. I was using another brand for about a month prior to using this. I liked the other brand but i wanted to see what else was out there and get the best. Well I'm done searching. This combines fruits and vegetables! I've been using this to supplement my breakfast and lunch throughout the day and i feel great!  I have more energy than before. I'm not getting tired halfway through the day anymore and i feel i have more mental focus.  I feel healthier than i ever have. I thought being \"regular\" was going once daily. Well since i've been taking this I go an hour after i eat usually. Overall hands down best product bar none. Get it from amazon too - in my local stores they are usually a good bit pricier.\n",

      "So, what I received were not in fact Salmiak Rocks, but Chocolate Rockies. The incredibly unfortunate thing about this is that these two products look incredibly similar and you cannot tell one from another until you eat them. As such I had already opened everything before I realized the error so I couldn't return them. The chocolate rockies weren't terrible, but they were not NEARLY as good as the salmiak rocks and moreover they weren't what I ordered. When you expect salty black licorice flavor and instead you get \"chocolate\" (I use the term loosely because the filling was akin to a tootsie roll) wrapped in black licorice, it's rather disappointing.<br /><br />I don't know how you can go about ensuring that you get the right thing here, which is a shame because the price is great and if it was in fact salmiak rocks, those are a delicious soft salty black licorice with a sweet molasses taste to it.<br /><br />If you do order this product, good luck.\n",

After two years of serving her \"wet food\" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.

Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes.

It is organic; soy and carrageenan free; and much better tasting to me than soy or almond milk. It's slightly sweet and very smooth. I drink it with all the traditional \"milk partners\", e.g., cookies ,pbj, and cereal. Especially good on cereal, I like to heat it up and pour it over granola.

I started out with a smaller version of Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seed, but used it all in smoothies, salads, and various recipes quickly, so I upgraded to the 5 lb. bucket.

I'm not a big consumer of salt, but this has so much flavor and so many health benefits, that I use salt more often now, but with this salt, I actually use much less at one time because it has so much flavor.  I use both the fine ground and the course, but I prefer the course in a grinder.  This brand is the best I've tried.\n",

It makes a wonderful gift.<br />Each person has had their unique experience with it.<br /><br />I'm thrilled it's available on Amazon-now I can use it and share it more freely.<br /><br />I've used Trivedi Water on plants with great success.<br /><br />Most recently I started using it on my skin.  Wow.  It's clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way I couldn't have imagined.<br />Truly amazing.<br /><br />And in terms of drinking Trivedi Water--the taste is indescribable. The closest I could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream--fresh, clear, and vital with a quality of softness to it.  It quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying.<br /><br />Try it.\n",

I found Oregon Chai mix at a local grcoery (then later I found a cheaper bulk 3-box pack at a grocery warehouse store), and I tried it. It can't be compared to a professionally made Chai (at least the way I make it), but it totally satisfies my requirement to be able to make it at home anytime I want.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I use Rice Dream instead of real milk, but it still qualifies as something that I can call a decent Chai drink conveniently made at home.  Extremely easy to make: you use 50% of this mixture and 50% of whatever kind of milk you use. And heat it up.\n",

      "While beef stew is almost too easy to make, I will admit to not being great at replenishing my seasonings supplies as needed. Because seasonings and spices/herbs are so expensive, I keep putting off purchasing them and the list to replenish them just keeps getting longer and longer. Eventually, I don't have anything with which to work. As such, I planned 2 6-qt crock pots of beef stew for over the holidays to always have something hearty and warm on hand for family as they came/went.  Lo and behold, when I finished cutting up all the meat and veggies and loaded them into the crock pots, I had nothing on hand to actually flavor those main ingredients. So, sent hubby off to the grocery store for a quick cheat...McCormick's beef stew seasoning packets. Of course I never told him how many to get, and as he wanted to 'do it right the first trip', he got a handful of them. Actually, in error, he grabbed the ones I'd never seen before: the \"SLOW COOKERS\" item. Man, oh, man! To heck with buying expensive, one-jar spices to keep on hand for this meal. This product worked perfectly! Open packet, mix with 1 1/3 Cups water, pour over ingredients in crock pot, mix it up just once and let the cooker rip for a few hours. The stew was excellently cooked, beef was so tender one needed a spoon with which to lift it otherwise it would break apart and the veggies were tender but not mooshy. It was more than flavorful; the au jus was not too thick and not too thin - perfect for sopping up with homemade bread that, unlike my spices, is always available in this house.<br /><br />I liked it so much, as did the family members, I'm back to purchase the pack of 12 here to keep on hand as well as the \"SLOW COOKERS\" for pot roast. I confess, for these two meals from now on, I'm being lazy, but quick and efficient. No serious measuring, no countless bottles of assorted spices, no mess and a tremendous result.<br /><br />NOTE: I did use 2 packets for each 6-qt slow cooker for although there is an easy recipe on the reverse of the packet, I don't measure my meat and veggies. I use what I have on hand and once the crock pot is at least 3/4 full, that's when I usually throw in my seasonings. The recipe provided would not be enough for my family. I didn't notice any additional recommendations on the packets indicating how much for what size slow cooker. I began with just one packet dissolved in the recommended 1 1/3 Cups of water (I used boiling water to dissolve it quicker add some warmth to the slow cooker as it begins cooking), but after pouring it over all the meat and veggies in the first pot, I just didn't think 1 packet was enough as my family likes a lot of the 'gravy'.  Therefore, I added an additional prepared packet to each 6-qt crock pot which gave me perfect results.<br /><br />This product uses only natural spices, no MSG, 0g trans fat per serving and no artificial flavors.<br /><br />Edit: 1/2/10 - Another batch made for New Year's...this time, I reduced the amount of water per packet to 1 Cup (vs 1 1/3) and got thicker, more substantial 'gravy' vs  the usual 'au jus' consistency. The family liked it much, much better that way.\n",

No water or oil or additives similar to MSG and it is not pulverized mushy little pieces like most supermarket tuna.  The tuna is in big pieces that I flake into large chunks and mix with the juice in the can.  I prefer this skipjack to the albacore, as it is more flavorful and moister.  Great for pasta salads, pasta main dishes, on a lettuce salad, sandwiches, tuna patties or for quick appetizer dips, etc, etc.  Even good just eating plain out of the can.  I highly recommend the excellent recipe from Triscuit box by Rachael Ray - Tuna and White Bean Salad - can Google to find it online.  This tuna is a good value for the price.\n",

      "One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered.\n",

With the assorted flavors, everyone can find one they like at least.  And it's fun to sample the different flavors.  Dark chocolate truffles are included and everyone knows now that dark chocolate is good for you.  (Chocolate is a vegetable, after all--chocolate is a bean.) These seem to have popular appeal--even my sons and their friends like them. The host/hostess can put these out for a party, and save some for their family.  They keep well in the wrapping and are a perfect after-dinner mini dessert.  I find one is enough for a tasty treat.  If you like chocolate, you should enjoy these bite-sized chocolate treats.\n",

The flavors were far more focused than with the Pink Lemonade and the Acai Pomegranate.  In fact, I also didn't get that `faux sugar flavor' in my throat this go around either.  I still find the ratio of packet to ounces of water to be a tad unsatisfactory (it doesn't produce much of a drink in the end) but I much prefer this flavor to the other two.  There wasn't the chalky aftertaste either, which was a BIG issue with the others.  It still isn't my favorite drink out there, and I don't feel that `boost' they are promoting, but at least this flavor gets the taste right.  For a second there it actually felt like I was downing an orange soft drink; for a second.\n",

They are perfect if you like really spicy candies. These candies are similar to the \"See's\" brand Crystallized Ginger and I feel that the quality is about the same as \"See's\". Unlike the See's brand, these do not have a chocolate coating which is good if you don't really like chocolate.<br /><br />I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people.<br /><br />These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy.

Overall, this seems to be a tremendous value.  16 oz is a lot of loose leaf tea!<br /><br />UPDATE 06.08.10<br />I just re-ordered the tea, and I wanted to note that Davidson's improved the packaging.  Rather than the packaging that is pictured, the product now comes in a resealable ziplock-type, foil-lined paper bag.  This type of packaging is ideal for tea and undoubtedly improves the freshness of the product.  I increased my rating by a star.  In my mind, this is the best deal in loose-leaf organic green tea!\n",

      "My daughter and I are on low carb diets.  She purchased this product as an alternative to peanut butter.  Don't make the same mistake.  It is unfortunate we cannot assign a negative number of stars.  She sadly bought the Peanut Butter Raisin variety as well.  I hate raisins, and I'm not stupid, so I didn't make the mistake of trying that one.<br /><br />This jar of congealed chemical matter is, by far, the most disgusting thing to ever have passed my lips.  On the plus side, it has no carbs, no calories, no fat, but it also has no protein, peanuts, or nutritional value of any kind.  It does have sodium.  I can only describe it as peanut flavored fluff.  No, not fluff, more like the gel-like substance in an air freshener.  I don't know what's worse, the flavor or the consistency.  To be labelled Walden Farms is purely scandalous.  It indicates to me that some ingredient within was perhaps in the vicinity of an actual farm.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say about this is, it will be fun to see the expressions on our friends' faces when we get them to taste it.\n",

Basically, anywhere you'd like to try paprika that is unlike anything you'll buy in a traditional american grocery, try this!  Your family or guests will be asking you how you came up with something so delicious!  Usually only available across seas, it is a secret you will be glad you discovered!\n",

      "I normally drink loose leaf tea.  However, the Revolution tea bags are amazing!<br /><br />1. They don't fill the bag with dust and fannings. There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.<br /><br />2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost-clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.<br /><br />3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.<br /><br />Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.\n",

I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now.

I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back!

      "My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently. The vet ran tons of VERY EXPENSIVE tests and for the most part ruled out anything that can be treated. We tried changing food but nothing worked. I tried giving him home cooked food as well and that made throwing up even worse. So one day I was in a pet store and the clerk said he had the same problem with his cat and suggested the MOST EXPENSIVE FOOD IN STORE. I was skeptical but I had nothing to lose (but money). Three years later my cat is doing fantastic. He only throw up when I feel bad for him and give him tuna as a pity treat. He's healthy, bouncy and seems to enjoy food. The big bag lasts us for ever. We bought a bag on November 5th and today again on March 19. That's 4+ months for $40 (which is how much the bag costs in pet store). I think I can afford $10/month for my buddy. I have no idea what's in there and I don't really care. All I care is that my cat looks happy and healthy. Food purists who believe in feeding cat organic chicken and brown rice might not care for it.\n",

      "My two favorite flavors of Ghirardelli chocolate squares are these Dark Chocolate with Caramel and the Dark Chocolate with Raspberry, but these are the best in my opinion.  I find the chocolate to be very firm and the caramel to be very creamy, less sweet than others I've had.  They are as pleasant as many creme caramels I have had, the burnt sugar flavor coming through.  Some of the squares actually were broken with the filling oozing out, but I rather enjoyed these as long as they didn't stick to the wrappers.  I'm not fond of licking the candy off the wrapper and discard those.  For this reason, I cannot give these a 5 star review.  I find that the wrappers are very easy to remove by simply tearing down the center seam and the confection can easily be popped into the mouth or nibbled while holding onto the chocolate inside the half wrapper.  These are especially good with a cup of strong coffee.  I have found that young children who like milk chocolate and/or candy bars were not fond of these.  They didn't mind the raspberry filled dark chocolate, but these were more of an \"adult\" taste that they didn't favor.\n",

I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

I like how this is organic and the nibbles are nice and hard to promote healthy teeth. I've also noticed my kitty's poop isn't stinky anymore because this food is of much better quality than the other so-called premium cat foods I've tried before.

The beans are dried and vacuum packed so I expect they have a very long shelf life and the expiration date is probably required rather than realistic. Dried beans have been stored for 30 years and found to still be good. Storing that long will probably have some loss of vitamin. A package packed as these are that is a couple years beyond the expiration date will probably have no noticeable difference in quality or taste.\n",

She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her.

      "I have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea.  This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors.  It is flavorful but mild.  Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />Be aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea.  If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot.  (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)<br /><br />I often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter.  It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking.  One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug.  I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.<br /><br />I also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me.  Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find.  This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.<br /><br />Note that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.  My local grocery store has stopped carrying the 25-count and only stocks the 18-count.  I like that Amazon carries the 25-count boxes since I go through a lot of this tea!  It is also a better deal at Amazon.<br /><br />I have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand.  Highly recommended.\n",

That is not what I want my coffee to taste like.<br /><br />Accordingly, I have been ordering a variety of the so-called \"medium roast\" varieties to assess them and find the right one for me.

The pineapple slices might be my favorite, I throw the can in the refrigerator the night before I eat them, makes them taste even better.<br /><br />BPA issue -- Random Native Forest reviews here on amazon had concerns about BPA in the cans so I emailed Edward and Son's (company that makes Native Forest brand) about the cans to find out the truth. The pineapples, pears, and peaches were on the list of BPA free cans that they emailed me back. The asparagus and baby corn that I bought were not, so i stopped buying them.<br /><br />As I did with my review of the peaches, I'll post the list of BPA free cans that I was given in the email in the comments. For those of you who don't care about the BPA issue, you should just know these are delicious.\n",

      "I seriously think whoever made the instructions for the alfredo sauce made a typo when stating how much water to add to the sauce.  If you follow the instructions to the letter, you will end up with something that looks like greenish library paste.  The following method yields a sauce more like alfredo sauce in consistency, rather than the stickier mac and cheese style sauce.<br /><br />Bring 1 cup to 1 1/4 cup water to boil in a small saucepan.  After water is boiling, gradually add sauce mix while stirring constantly with a whisk.  After all the mix is combined, add 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp garlic powder and a pinch of salt.  Cook until sauce is at desired consistency, stirring occasionally.  This makes enough sauce for me to have two meals of veggies and noodles, but I like a lot of sauce.\n",

      "These cookies are a life saver in the morning!  I am busy chasing my toddler around as soon as her tiny feet hit the floor when she gets out of bed.  I take one of these out of the freezer and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds while I chop up fruit for Tiny's breakfast.  When she points at my breakfast asking for a bite, I feel good knowing these cookies aren't frankenfood and give her few pinches to share with her.  They are a great way to start the day; paired with a cup of coffee, a bit of fruit and a glass of water -- I am totally full until lunch.<br /><br />The banana walnut flavor is just like chewy, dense banana bread.  The nuts are nice and crunchy and taste very fresh.  These are such a deal at about a buck a cookie with S&S on amazon; the ingredients and consistant product quality make it money well spent.<br /><br />I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave. I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven. I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.<br /><br />UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime. They are very filling and are perfect for when you don't have time to make anything.\n",

The instructions are adequate.  The kit includes everything and is a good place to start. If it were not for a few poor quality parts, I would give it a 5 star. Use Saran wrap on your roller and life will be easier. Following instructions for rice came close to burning rice  instructions not fully complete, limp recipes.

Lightly held together with a candy glue and cut into little squares. Well, how could I possibly  resist? Into the shopping cart they went along with a nice-looking bag of trail mix. I love snacks like this. They're tasty and satisfy my snacking urges, yet they're made out of nutritious ingredients including protein and fiber. Did I mention that they're fresh and delicious? Plus, they have limited saturated fat, no trans fat and not very much sugar. Mmmmm, good. A Perfect treat, just so I don't eat too many.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",

      "Very excellent coffee candy. And you get a nice set of 12 bags which contain 42 candies each.  Each bag is 5.3 ounces.  I am attaching two photos of a box with all the candy bags - I was pleasantly surprised by the amount and the weight of the package.<br /><br />I decided to try Bali's Best Coffee Candy after trying Kopiko coffee Candy. I really liked the candy but thought the price was too much ($5.49 for 32 candies, 4.23 oz).  So I decided to try this Bali's Best Coffee Candy. Bali's has stronger coffee taste and slightly sweeter.  Both are excellent candy, but Bali's is a much better deal.<br /><br />I noticed that the price on the Coffee candy fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter \"price history alert\" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful.\n",

It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.

      "I've used this litter for at least six months now.  My cats (all between 7 and 12 pounds), who were used to a very soft wheat-based litter, accepted this very easily and it actually does last a long time, although maybe not 100% as long as they claim.  I do have one cat who gets SQ fluids for kidney problems, so she probably does urinate more often than normal cats; therefore I don't feel confident arguing about the manufacturer's claims for longevity.<br /><br />The thing that surprised me the most is that even as the litter gets really old, the litter box still does not smell like cat urine.  It's not until the litter is completely saturated at the end of its life that you start to smell urine.  I have a friend who uses another brand of silica litter, and it gets the stench of urine almost immediately, so I think Litter Pearls are worth the premium for odor control.  You can still smell the cat poop a little, of course.<br /><br />One of my cats has asthma, and the vet recommended using this to lower the dust exposure for him.  This is not 100% dust free, but compared to most litters it is much closer to reaching that claim, and we love that because there was a pervasive coat of dust all over the house with the wheat-based litter.  This litter still tracks, but the cats don't emerge from the boxes with dust-covered feet so we don't have to look at dusty paw prints all over the house any more.  As for the round crystals being difficult to vacuum, there is some truth to that, especially with hardwood floors; however, I really haven't found the vacuuming issue to be terribly inconvenient, and since my cats are accustomed to soft litters, I've stuck with the round crystals.\n",

This is probably because there is very little green tea in this mixture.  The flavor mostly comes from the toasted brown rice.  This is a nice enough flavor, but it is not really like a more traditional genmaicha which has the flavors of both the toasted rice plus the green tea.<br /><br />I prefer either the Yamamotoyama or the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company versions of genmaicha for commercially available sources.  The best tea would come from specialty importers, but that would be quite a bit more expensive.\n",

I use these more of a quick breakfast with a side of greek yogurt. It is filling and I can barely finish a whole packet.

It is a bit dry but that is kinda the nature of these protein infused snacks/foods. I just love the crunch and it's nice to have that back again. I would compare it to a very weak golden graham with the consistency of a mini wheat without the stringy kinda mini wheat texture (if that makes sense at all, ha!)<br /><br />I have also started using this as a breakfast cereal. Adding it to soy milk with a little banana. It does get soggy in a few minutes but I still find it quite tasty as a high protein ceral in the morning.

      "I saw a case of 6 boxes of the lemon shortbread cookies for sale at the Amazon warehouse online (when did this start? It's great) for $8.99.  I had never tried any of Pamela's cookies.  I love lemon so I decided to buy the case.  I read several reviews.  Most people liked/loved them.  One person said they were really tart.  Another person, one of the few who didn't like them, said they tasted something like lemon pledge had been sprayed on them.  I am writing to share my opinion that they are neither really tart nor taste like lemon pledge.  They are a lemon flavored buttery shortbread cookie. The shortbread does a lot to cut the tartness.  I found them just perfectly lemony without being overbearing. They are a delicate cookie that is easy to eat.  Unfortunately the delicateness caused a couple to break into pieces.  I don't find that to be a problem because I break my cookies into bites before I eat them anyway.  Don't be afraid to try these cookies if you like lemon.  They are definitely worth a try, especially if you get them from the warehouse.  I'll order again even if I have to pay full price next time.\n",

      "I was hoping to save some of my shoes and some money. Rawhides scare me, kongs require effort and increased calories and I had heard good things about Nylabones. My dog will not touch the originals and will occasionally chew on the chocolate one for a couple of minutes. I wouldn't get the value pack before confirming that my dog A. likes Nylabones and B. likes the originals. If you're insistent on getting these and you have a chewer, I would consider going a size up.<br /><br />I ended up getting a naturally shed deer antler - they cost a little more but last a really long time, don't get dirty like nylabones, are odorless and are actual bones so the vast majority of dogs like them. If you can find the ones that are cut through the middle so they expose more marrow - your dog will probably be entertained for longer periods of time. Bully sticks are also pretty much a guaranteed hit, although my boyfriend calls them butt sticks because of the terrible smell. Comment if you find something else that works. :)<br /><br />Update: While the nylabone still isn't his favorite - He does chew the chocolate one a little longer after I took it away and pretended that it was my phone a few different times. It also seems that it becomes more interesting after he chewed the outside lawyer some and gave it some texture.\n",

Well, I brought my new purchase to work this morning, and brewed my first cup.  The aroma was pleasant ... could smell the apple right away and then a few moments later could smell the caramel.  But then I tasted it - and it was awful!  I sipped it hot, sipped it warm, and even tried another cup with a different amount of water.  I'm done!

Apparently, they had a bad batch with their old manufacturing plant where the bottles were not being sealed properly and have since spoiled.  She asked me some questions about the bottle, got some order numbers and cap numbers from me, and they are sending me out some replacement cases.  They were very friendly, apologetic and helpful.

Because of this I don't know if they actually work (if they're the same texture what makes them different from cat food?) but I don't think they're dangerous, as a previous reviewer said. Canine Greenies have caused health problems, but from what I understand it is because the dog didn't chew it well (like most dogs) and because of the softer texture it swelled in the dogs stomach.<br /><br /> My cats love the salmon flavor, the package recommends six pieces three times a day, not to exceed 18 pieces a day. I give my cats about six a day, all at once. They don't always chew them though, which is the only problem I've had with the product, swallowing them whole doesn't bother my cats at all though. I have one cat, Garfield, who is very picky, but he loves these treats. So I think its probably safe to say that these shouldn't cause health problems like the canine Greenies can and also that your cat will really like them!\n",

We normally buy them at COSTCO but they were out for two months, so I ordered them at Amazon. Quite a mark up guys! I pay $9.39 for a 2.5 lb bag at Costco and $25.00 at Amazon!! Today, Costco carried them again, so I stocked up. They are excellent treats and my dogs are worth it, but come on guys, THAT much of a markup?? Yikes!\n",

With most of the frozen crusts, I think there's some extra moisture that causes it to not crisp.<br /><br />If you're like me, you tend to find a brand that you like and buy other products from them.  I've done that with Schar.  I've tried the bread, shortbread cookies, pasta, vanilla wafers, and choc. hazelnut bars.  My least favorite is the hazelnut bars.  My absolute favorite is the vanilla wafers.  The texture and consistency of them is great.\n",

      "I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture.\n",

      "Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from \"Sports\" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled  nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them  with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). On bad days when she can't eat solid food, I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb-El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake.\n",

      "For those of us used to Tuna in the can this product seems very unique and certainly economical if you have several people in your family.<br />What you are getting is a single solid slab of tuna measuring approx. 6 inches wide 9 inches long and 1 inch thick. 2 whole pounds of Wild Planet's low mercury wild caught tuna. As you can see from the reviews of their canned Tuna this really is a very delicious Tuna and they cook it right in the aluminum type pouch that it comes in. When you open the pouch the juices from that cooking are evident. I know many of you probably have bought fresh Tuna in the fish market and find canned Tuna of no comparison. I, myself have only done that once and it turned out very dry and leathery when broiled. I don't know how to compare a Tuna loin like this to a fresh cooked piece of Tuna but if you don't have access to fresh tuna or just want a high quality Tuna for sandwiches or other dishes I truly don't know where you could find a higher quality and certainly more economical piece of fish. This truly is a novel idea whose time has come. Taking a large, fresh piece of fish and putting it in a sealed pouch and cooking it. It is the next best thing to fresh fish, especially when your favorite fish is not in season or available frozen.<br />I wish someone would package Sockeye Salmon like this. The only ingredients in this product are Tuna and sea salt. None of the extenders etc.. in commercial store bought Tuna. Now, Wild Planet's new can's of Tuna are 5 ounces, so you would have to buy 6 1/3 cans to equal this 2 lb. pouch. A cost of $27.00 verses $16.00. So you can see it certainly is a better bargin. The only caveat to ordering this product in such a large size is that once you open it you only have x amount of days to eat it. No problem for a family of 3 or 4 but if it is just one person it may prove to be a bit to much when all you want is one Tuna sandwich, but, I have found that by eating a little each day I can finish a package in 4 days just by having a piece once a day. It's a great way to get some extra protein and omega 3's and I really look forward to having it because it tastes so good. I hope this was helpful.\n",

Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****\n",

Buying a pack of 50 was too much since I have no idea how it tastes like so I bought a 3 pack sample from my local Starbucks. I've got to say this is definitely one the better tasting instant coffee's I have tried.

Those definitely got the job done but it just wasn't very fun drinking them. With the VIA, the coffee actually tastes fresh and lively.

The price is insane! Iherb has it for 4.27 right now. If you haven't bought from iherb before my reward code HUM176 can save you 5 bucks off your first purchase. Shipping is free if you spend 20 bucks so it's a great deal. You can stock up like I did.\n",

It holds the exact amount of k-cups that it says it would and I was actually glad that I picked the 54 cup pod drawer over the 36 cup pod drawer as I have a lot of k-cups to store. I even placed some of my extra k-cups on the top of this shelf until I can put them into the drawers.<br /><br />I noticed that someone had said they could fit extra k-cups into their drawer by alternating one up and one down. I found this annoying as I couldn't see what all the flavors of coffee were being stored in the drawer. I could only fit one extra k-cup per line in the drawer anyway so I didn't find this needed or unnecessary.<br /><br />So if I enjoy it so much, why knock it down by one star?<br /><br />I noticed that the drawer is bent just slightly. It's a sturdy drawer, but it's not as sturdy as it could be it seems, the wire bent in slightly more one one side than the other. It would be nice if it had been made out of slightly stronger metal that didn't bend as easily. Also, some of the drawers slide very smoothly while others pull out a little harder because the wire that they slide on is a bit bent as well.\n",

      "This sweet and smooth spread is a delicious topping for your morning brioche or your evening ice cream alike. If you have never tried this before, it is like a honey of creamed chestnuts. Even that description does not do it justice. Perhaps try to imagine a cross between Nutella and honey, but with no hint of chocolate. It spreads easily over breads, though I highly recommend you try it on something that is not coarse like American toast and not too sweet like a muffin. Let the flavor of the spread speak for itself by trying it on a sweet roll, brioche, or similarly basic bread. It is difficult to find in the United States, so I am delighted that Amazon sells a variety of Creme de Marrons.<br /><br />The container itself is good, resisting cracks or damage during daily wear and tear. Since this is a food that appeals to children, it makes sense to not have it packaged in glass or another breakable material. This tin and its classic paper label are so darling that I cannot bear to part with it so I wash it out to reuse as a pencil cup.<br /><br />This food product is not recommended for someone with blood sugar tolerance issues or trying to lose weight.\n",

But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.<br /><br />  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.<br /><br />  Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.<br /><br />  But the situation was becoming dangerous.

The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.\n",

      "These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the \"large\" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the \"small\" cup and good on the \"large\" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

      "This is one of the most unnecessary and ridiculously over-priced baby items I own, yet I can't help loving it. Common sense tells me that I could just as easily cook food on the stove and puree it in a blender, in even greater quantities than are allowed by the Beaba Babycook, but this is such an adorable little appliance, with such a straightforward cooking process, that it totally motivates me to use it and hence we have a freezer full of baby food cubes. It is definitely NOT useful, however, for reheating food - I followed the directions for defrosting/reheating, and it came out scalding hot. The other minus is that it comes with very few recipes, even on the website that initially looks impressive but is actually quite sparse. Bottom line - if you're a sucker for attractive kitchen gadgets and have a rich uncle who wants to buy you an extravagant shower gift, this is the perfect item! Otherwise, buy a blender - at least you can make frozen margaritas with it as well.<br /><br />Update: 3 months after I purchased the Beaba, I still use it CONSTANTLY. Occasionally, I bake or steam food using the oven/stove and blend it in a blender, but I have to say that the Beaba is much more convenient. And I would now up my rating to 5 stars - I recently got distracted while steaming some beets on the stove (imagine that, getting distracted with a 9 month old son) and burned out the bottom of the pot. The Beaba is now the only thing I use for steaming because it automatically turns off when it's done cooking, and I can't stress enough the peace of mind I get from this safety feature, as any mommy with baby brain can understand! If you can afford it - buy it.\n",

      "I agree that this isn't terribly tricky and that cats can get the treats out relatively quickly, but they still love it and get very excited when they see me filling up their \"treat balls.\"  Because of the ease of getting the food out I usually fill these up with their regular kibble and let them use it to get some or all of their morning meal-definitely more fun and more active than the usual hovering over the bowl.<br /><br />Instead of giving each of my cats their own treat ball, I've started to put one treat ball out at a time-it makes it more challenging and fun for them to have to chase and battle for access to the treat ball (assuming your cats get along as well as ours do.)  They make it like a game of soccer, and its very funny to see them trying to steal the ball from each other and to block the ball from being stolen while they chomp down the food that they have earned.  One of my cats even has figured out how to \"guard\" the ball by sitting on it while he is busy eating the treat that fell out.  Another has perfected the \"swat\".\n",

Stays crunchy - the best flaked cereal I have found for staying crunchy in milk, maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier/thicker than standard flakes.<br /><br />3.  Taste - last but not least, too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard, but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack.<br /><br />This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix.  The other ingredients are Kashi's 7 Whole Grain Puffs, dried cranberries, pecans, and flax seed. With Heritage & Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast:<br /><br />1.  Spelt<br /><br />2.  Quinoa<br /><br />3.  Kamut<br /><br />4.  Millet<br /><br />5.  Buckwheat<br /><br />6.  Triticale<br /><br />7.  Rye<br /><br />8.  Red Winter Wheat<br /><br />9.  Barley<br /><br />10. Oats<br /><br />11. Brown Rice<br /><br />12. Sesame Seeds<br /><br />Then I add the following to the bowl:<br /><br />13. Flax Seeds - about a tablespoon<br /><br />14. Pecans - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />15. Dried Cranberries - about 2 tablespoons<br /><br />Then if you really want to go full-on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage, the best soy milk out there...see my review of it.\n",

Nothing could prepare me for how much I would enjoy it. With a flavor slightly reminiscent of Orangina, it combines the zest of the labeled fruit, with a light amount of sweetener, and crisp carbonation. It's refreshing and, best of all, only cost $1.50 before tax at my local convenience mart, so I was a bit floored when Amazon's vendor decided to charge $3.25/bottle through Amazon. For those prices, I could go down the street and buy out the local shop's complete supply of Mash at a handsome profit to the store owner and 50% savings for myself. Maybe that's the intent.\n",

I mixed it with the sauce and some grilled chicken, but had to stop eating it.  It made me gag after a while.  I tried so hard to like it, but just couldn't.

      "Hojicha is a delicious every day tea. And the Mighty Leaf bags are especially nice because they're silken and won't impart any \"paper\" flavor into your brew. I hunted down this tea after suffering too many terrible decaf black teas. True, hojicha has a bit more caffeine than a decaf tea, but when I consider the flavor pay-off (nice subtle smokiness, not even a hint of bitterness) I can't really go back. Sometimes, I \"decaffeinate\" it myself by letting it steep for 45 seconds in hot water, tossing out the brew, and then drinking the second infusion. (From what I've read, the caffeine comes out in the initial steeping). I lose a little flavor when I do this, but it's still much tastier than any commercial decaf I've ever had.\n",

      "I confess that I never would have actually purchased a Keurig coffee maker, but I received one as a gift and I have found it to be a useful and enjoyable toy. Being able to brew one high-quality cup of coffee is indeed one of life's little luxuries.<br /><br />Like other single-serving, prepackaged food technologies, however, Keurig k-cup coffee tends toward the expensive when compared to whole bean or tinned ground coffee. If for this reason alone the Amazon \"subscribe and save\" approach to buying K-cups would be a fabulous institution. By having the coffee delivered at regular intervals (with free shipping!) the cost is reduced considerably.<br /><br />But which coffees to buy? I selected Jet Fuel partly, I confess, because the name is so darned cute. The (relatively) non-wasteful packaging also was an attraction, though let's face it, there is plenty of plastic residue associated with this brewing technology. The Coffee People at least minimize the waste, however, and for this I salute them.<br /><br />What about the coffee itself? Jet Fuel is a dark, rich, full-bodied coffee that to me is reminiscent of the \"industrial strength\" coffee I can get at Peet's, my favorite west coast coffee purveyor/establishment. In other words, it's amazingly delicious.  The Keurig system allows you to select the strength you want.<br /><br />Overall, Jet Fuel is a winner for fans of robust coffee. Bon appetit!\n",

I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Natural Orange is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and root beer, however all their flavors are yummy!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either.<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!\n",

Paying $49.50 for 12 bottles of V8 simply isn't smart because you can just as easily buy this at your local store. It's doubly idiotic because it's the smaller 46 oz size. I bought a 64 oz bottle (2 QT) from Walgreens tonight for $3. I'll do the math for you. $49.50/12 = $4.12 a bottle (9¢/oz). Mine is 4.6¢/oz. Amazon's is twice as expensive.<br /><br />I suppose if you are house-bound or overseas and must have a case of V8, you could order this. For the rest of us with working feet and/or cars, we could just go down to the local grocery store or supermarket/Costco.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/11:<br />Amazon has lowered the price, but it's still not competitive w/ Walgreens when there's a sale. $3.32/can for the smaller 46 oz size vs. my 64 oz bottles.\n",

Lots of times I'll also add some low sodium chicken bouillon to the recipe.<br /><br />I've even served the recipe above to company - including family who would have NO qualms telling me it was awful and even they thought it wasn't bad.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not wild about this as it comes out of the jar. I do think it needs to be \"doctored\" up and you absolutely won't mistake this for the yummy chicken fettucini you can get at a nice restaurant but if you are watching calories/carbs or on a restricted diet then this is not a bad alternative.\n",

      "This is my favorite brand of Thai red curry paste.  We use it to make thai curry at home, because it's soooo simple to make.  Chop 1 onion into chunks, heat up 2 tbsp. of canola oil in a wok or dutch oven, toss in the onions and stir for a minute or so until translucent.  Take 1 tbsp of Mae Ploy red curry paste for a mild curry (use 3 tbsp. if you enjoy spicy foods like jalapenos) and stir into the onions, stir and heat for a minute, then pour in half a can of coconut milk, stir again, and turn heat to medium, toss in 1 lb. of cubed meat (beef or chicken or pork or duck), 2 lime leaves, a few dashes of fish sauce, stir to mix well. Turn heat down to simmer for 15 minutes, add chopped bell pepper strips, bamboo shoots and 2 handfuls of fresh basil, simmer for another 10 minutes. Pour in the remaining half of coconut milk, stir to mix well, then turn off heat immediately. Remove the lime leaves. Serve with steamed rice.<br /><br />The other reason we love Mae Ploy brand so much is because it's the only brand available here locally that has NO MSG, NO PRESERVATIVES. Thank GOD for Mae Ploy !!!\n",

I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these.

And it was a bunch of random bars thrown into a plastic bag, not even taped into a misleading factory box, as the other reviewer's had been.<br /><br />Bottom line, what you see in the picture, 16 bars of different flavors, is what you get.  In my mind that's a rip-off.  For that money, I could have gotten two boxes of 24, but I did have the convenience of being able to try all the different flavors and not being stuck with 23 of one variety that I wasn't fond of.\n",

      "Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is \"sub-par\" compared to the \"very top\" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the \"cons\" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!\n",

By lunchtime I am usually pretty hungry, but I can hold out until lunchtime without a problem.  They are a bit dry, so I always have a drink on hand while eating them.  The chocolate flavor is great, not that cheap tasting chocolate that usually comes with diet products.  The bar has a nice chew, but isn't overly chewy, nor does it stick to the teeth.  They have a good flavor - not the best bar I have ever eaten as far as taste goes, but better than tolerable for sure.  These bars are lower in fat content to some of the Slim Fast meal replacement bars, which is why I tried them in the first place.<br /><br />This high fiber bar will keep you feeling full for several hours, and replacing a meal a day with them does create results.

      "I have now tried several different Matcha's. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST<br /><br />I am very sensitive to substances that go into my body. Do your research. I did.<br /><br />I drink Green Tea for the health benefits. I am 61 years old now. My metabolism has slowed. My brain never tolerated caffeine very well. And, I do not want or like to be physically addicted to any drug (caffeine). When I was in Iraq, I drank caffeinate concentrated coffee (1 can of triple shot) per day. When I missed a day or two, my body went into a sluggish withdrawal with headache/stuffy brain. That was awful.<br /><br />I read about this Do Matcha Green Tea and how the other substances (Catechins, etc.) in it were so healthful and that the caffeine was low. I tried it and found there were no withdrawal symptoms after drinking one cup every day for a week. To my surprise it was just as uplifting as the Triple Shot had been, but with less than a third of the caffeine. It also had a very calming effect and produced a mental clarity I enjoyed in my 20's and 30's.<br /><br />The other Matcha's I tried because of cheaper price failed to produce the mental clarity. Mental clarity is what I missed the most in getting older. Only Do Matcha first harvest (Ceremonial Grade) has produced this. Read up on this so that I do not have to write so much to impart knowledge to those who do not know.<br /><br />I do not drink this for the taste. I drink it for the health benefits. The others DO NOT measure up to Do Matcha!!!<br /><br />You get what you pay for. Many extoll the different mixes they use Green Tea for. That is not me. I drink it straight with cool water. I don't want to lose any of the nutrition because of heated water. I use a battery operated frother to mix it. I like the veggie taste (like raw spinach). It is a quick drink that uplifts, enlivens, and clarifies. If you need to enhance your life. Pay for this. Yes, it is expensive... and worth the extra cost if you value your health.<br /><br />My body has become more supple. No more morning stiffness. No more morning grogginess. No more sore feet when getting out of bed. I have been using Do Matcha (and tried others) for 7 months now. I can quit without any signs of withdrawal. But, the age factors set in again.<br /><br />So, one cup a day of Do Matcha seems to be quite therapeutic for me.\n",

I usually make sandwiches with regular Spam, mayo, lettuce, and a slice of yellow American cheese. After this came in, I made the same sandwich, minus the slice of cheese, since this Spam had cheese already mixed in. I could taste the cheese, however, the cheese flavor was not as strong as the sandwich with regular Spam and a slice of American.<br /><br />* * * WARNING * * *<br /><br />Spam is famous for being high in sodium - the reason it keeps so long. I received my delivery yesterday (October 28th, 2011) and the best by date was some time in 2014 (don't remember what month).<br />Regular Spam has 730mg of Sodium per 85 grams (3 ounces), or roughly 243mg of sodium per ounce. Spam with Cheese (according to the label) has 720mg of sodium per 2 ounces, or 360mg per ounce.<br /><br />That's 50% more sodium than regular Spam. That is a huge jump for something that is famous for being high in sodium.<br />This is definitely something to consider if you have high blood pressure, like I do.<br /><br />If your blood pressure is in check, and you like Spam, give this product a try. It is tasty. :)\n",

      "I was a bit skeptical about ordering this coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's very good and the cost is a fraction of what other K-cups are going for these days. I paid less than .50 per cup. I have a Keurig Platinum Edition brewer (from America's favorite home shopping channel:) and the cups work fine in my machine. I prefer a medium roast flavor so I brew the 8 oz cup and it does not taste watered down. If you prefer a light tasting coffee you could even brew the next size up; someone who enjoys a darker flavor may want to use the smaller cup setting. The cups do fit in my Keurig carousel display holder. However, the coffee is essentially contained in a thick paper filter so if you won't be using the pods quickly then you might want to get yourself an airtight container to store the unused pods/cups to maintain freshness. They arrive in a vacuum-sealed package that is not resealable. If you're on the fence about whether or not to try this brand, go for it - you'll be glad you did.\n",

      "If you expect this to taste just like the Verona you get at the Starbucks store, you will be disappointed. It's close, but be sure to use the medium cup setting. A better (and presently more expensive) Starbucks K-cup is their French Roast. Nevertheless, all of the Starbucks K-cups are over-priced, presumably because of the name. To my taste, there are a number of better dark roasts available at more reasonable prices, including two of my favorites, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7N2\">Green Mountain Double Black Diamond</a> and especially <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain Revv)</a>.

      "Welcome to heaven, Judy.<br />What?<br />Yes, you have arrived.<br />What?<br />You are asleep now, thanks to Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea.<br />But I don't remember going to sleep.<br />My point exactly. That's why I call it heaven.<br />But who are you?<br />I am Sleepytime Judy and I am asleep.<br /><br />What welcome relief, knowing there is a pleasant, calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down. Just walk to the kitchen, put the kettle on, pull out a Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime teabag, place in a favorite cup--mine is a slender version of a Blue Willow cup, pour on water at just the boiling point, and wait for the tea to steep.<br /><br />Meanwhile, pick up the box--how many times now--and read the the words.<br />\"100% Natural Herb Tea, Caffeine Free.\"<br />\"a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses...\"<br />\"...it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world...\"<br />'The sweetest way I think of you is when the day is done.' Emily Dickinson<br />Ingredients: Chamomile, spearmint, lemon grass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorn berries, and rosebuds.<br /><br />But before I take my cup back to bed, I look at the last panel of the box. There's papa bear asleep in his cozy chair in front of the fire, Mama is carrying the baby and holding the hand of another, taking them to bed. Through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed. All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.<br /><br />I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping. I have learned that if I sip my usual slow sipping, I will fall asleep only halfway finished. That is how efficacious the tea... really... is.....\n",

They were soft and tasty--much like my home-baked peanut butter cookies--only better since I tend to over-bake mine!<br /><br />I have many allergies so it's difficult for me to find pre-made cookies I can safely eat.  Barley and corn starch, which I am very allergic to, find their way masked in many ingredients for pre-made food products.  I was very glad to find the ingredients in these cookies are safe for me:  Peanut Butter;  Molasses; Eggs; Rice Syrup and Grape Juice; Flour Base (Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Sweet Rice Flour, Xanthum Gum); Dry Roasted Peanut Pieces; Gluten-free Natural Flavor, Baking Soda; Sea Salt. This means they are gluten-free as well.<br /><br />With only 11g of carbohydrates, 7 g of sugar, and 3 g of protein, I can indulge with 2 for a mid-day snack without the guilt!<br /><br />If you are too busy to make home-baked cookies yourself, these are certainly a viable alternative...and they're quite healthy, too!

      "We've used Yoder's canned bacon for several years - mainly for the times when company comes and I don't have fresh bacon handy.  We keep a case of it for emergencies too.  There's no reason to do without favorites like bacon just because the power is out.  They're great to toss in a backpack for camping, and people are often amazed to see that bacon comes in cans.<br /><br />There are about 50 slices in each can, cooked and ready to eat(we like our crispy, this is more limp), rolled up in paper.  The cans will last a decade if kept at normal home temperatures.  We pull out the paper and unroll it, then finish crisping up the bacon in a frying pan.  It gives off just enough grease to fry eggs, which is great for camping.  You can also soak the can in hot water to ease the paper/bacon out of the can.<br /><br />There's a lot of arguing in the reviews about the pricing of this bacon, but I consider it a good value.  Each can contains several pounds (pre-cooked) of bacon, and currently bacon is around $4 per pound at the grocery.  Plus being able to store it on a shelf and even eat it right out of the can makes it worth the extra cost.<br /><br />This canned bacon is a really useful product that we don't ever plan to do without.\n",

However, it takes a little experimenting with all the methods of cooking to find the cooking method that is right for your individual taste.  I invested in a small (6 cup) microwave rice cooker and use the following recipe:  Bring 1 cup of water to a rolling boil in an uncovered microwave rice cooker.  Stir in 1/4 cup oatmeal, cover and lock rice cooker lid and allow to sit overnight.  The next morning place rice cooker in microwave and cook for approximately 12 minutes at 40% power (Using reduced power keeps the rice cooker from overflowing).  Remove from microwave and let sit for 7-10 minutes.  Remove lid and add toppings of your choice (brown sugar, butter, milk, dried fruit, stir & enjoy. Makes 1 serving.\n",

I wasn't too sure if it would be any good since being on the clearance rack usually means \"old\" and \"not too good\".  However, after enjoying a cup of Tully's Kona blend I'm confused.  The coffee flavor was exactly what I would expect from a Kona blend: smooth, mellow delicious coffee without the bitterness of Columbian coffees.  It had a great aroma.  The k-cups keeps the coffee fresh, so, even though it's pushing it's \"sell by\" date, it tastes like the beans were freshly ground.<br /><br />If you expect this to be just as good as the Kona you got during that Hawaiian vacation, lower your expectations just a little.  This coffee is really good, but it is still a blend.\n",

      "I have been a fan of Peet's coffee for nearly 30 years, starting from when I was a student at UC Berkeley. Peet's had a few cafe's in Berkeley, roasting their coffee on the premises. People standing in line always got a small cup of complimentary coffee, brewed super strong and served hot and black, not for the faint-of-heart. Major Dickason's blend has long been my favorite - strong, rich, smooth. When my brother moved to Seattle he was ecstatic that he had found a local cafe that was almost as good as Peet's. The name of the cafe was Starbuck's. Some years later Starbuck's and Peet's joined forces, but eventually Starbuck's expanded internationally and Peet's chose to stay local. Peet's wanted to keep its coffee pure (not mixed with syrups and whipped cream) and didn't want to compromise its quality by expanding too quickly. I am so thankful that Peet's chose to stay true to what excellent coffee is really about, and since I moved away from Berkeley I am thankful that logistics have improved, and I can get fresh Peet's shipped to me (even now that I am living overseas).<br /><br />While I could go on and on about Peet's, which I love passionately, it is not a coffee for everyone. It is much stronger and richer than most, and some people whom I have served it to have found it to be too strong (I guess I could have brewed it with less coffee grounds or mixed some hot water in at the end, but it didn't occur to me at the time). But if you really love coffee, and you want something much much much better than Starbuck's, then you might really like Peet's.\n",

      "I'm a huge fan of iced coffee, but I don't own a coffee pot.  I recall trying Starbucks VIA in stores a few months ago, and the barista telling me that it could dissolve in cold water or milk (unlike normal instant coffees), and tucked it away in the back of my head to try it this summer.  I was pleasantly surprised when Starbucks came out with the VIA Iced Coffee packages, mostly because it was designed for a 16 oz serving and lightly sweetened with sugar (100 calories in the entire packet, 50 calories for an 8 oz serving).  I add it directly to 16 oz of skim milk, add a little extra sweetener, and shake it all up in a water bottle.  It's delicious!  It has the classic Starbucks coffee flavor, without being overly bitter, because the coffee hasn't been brewed.  It dissolves almost instantly, sugar and coffee and all, in COLD liquid, with no residue or sediment at the bottom.<br /><br />At $1.00 a packet, it's not cheap - but it is cheaper than getting an iced coffee at Starbucks, and just as delicious - plus, you don't need to leave your house.  I used to make cold brewed coffee to drink iced, but that has to be done the night before to extract the full flavor, and then you need to strain it, and to make larger quantities was just cumbersome without the right equipment.  I love that I can just pour a packet into a water bottle, add water or milk and sweeteners, and instantly have delicious iced coffee!\n",

This grinder is absolutely the best! It grinds down some of the larger, rougher spices into a smaller format which is easier to digest and apply to seafood, chicken, etc. I use it on so many foods! Chicken and seafood is a given. Just spray your \"to be broiled\" seafood or chicken with some light oil and apply the herbs to both sides. It gives the meat a wonderful flavor.<br />I also now make very light, low calorie tarter sauce with the herbs. I use very light ranch dressing; add chopped pickles, herbs de provence and dill; along with chopped onions occassionally. The tarter sauce is much better in taste and has almost no calories.

They were very kind to share it with me, but said I would NEVER find the secret ingredient Monin raspberry syrup. Well, that drink was so good, I was determined to lay my hands on this syrup! Luckily, I found it on Amazon!! Here is the recipe:<br /><br />Lemon Raspberry Martini<br /><br />2 oz Limoncello<br />1/2 oz Grey Goose vodka<br />1/4 oz Monin Raspberry syrup<br />1 oz cranberry juice<br />1/2 oz sweet sour mix (liquid)<br /><br />Mix all ingredients together in a shaker with lots of ice. Strain into two martini glasses. Add a twist of lemon and ENJOY!!!\n",

      "These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture.  Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.  I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case.  The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid.  When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive.\n",

It did a great job at keeping my cat healthy, and never had a problem with urinary tract again while on this food. The only reason i give this 3 stars and not five, is because my cat doesn't like it(he is not really a picky eater, he eats a wide variety of things). He will only eat it when absolutely starving or when mixed in with other dry or canned foods. Right now i am feeding him friskies special diet canned food, as well as iams proactive health original with chicken. This combination he really enjoys and it has given great results with his UTI problem (which has not reoccurred in over a year). Since i still have about half a bag left of PurinaOne, i just leave out a bowl for him at night so he can eat if really hungry, but half a cup usually lasts about 4 or 5 days before he eats it all. It is a very good product which does its job wonderfully, it is just not for my particular cat.\n",

      "A normal, off the shelf pasta has about 220 calories per 2oz (dry, uncooked) serving.  Very few people actually eat JUST 2 ounces -- this is why pasta has gotten such a bad reputation in the quest to loose weight or maintain a healthy weight.  The wheat provides a small amount of protein, but unless you're eating whole wheat pasta (ik) it doesn't provide fiber.<br /><br />Enter Fiber Gourmet products!  That same 2oz dry serving has only 130 calories, plus it also has 18 (can you believe it?) grams of fiber.  And it isn't grainy like whole wheat pasta, or slimy like some of the low-carb things that hit the market a few years ago with the Adkins craze.  In fact, it tastes just like regular pasta.<br /><br />And they make it in several of the most popular shapes.  And if you go to the Fiber Gourmet site, they also make it in several popular flavors -- my favorites are the red/black pepper, the cajun, and the garlic/parsley.  They evidently also make tomato, but have been out of it every time I've gone looking.<br /><br />It's really good stuff.  :D  Hard to argue with 130 calories and 18g of fiber, now matter what kind of sauce or pesto you put on it!\n",

With a brand name like \"Kind\" it's a leap of faith I'm willing to take.  What I do know, however, is this stuff is tasty.<br /><br />The smell from the bag is earthy, with a little cinnamon, a little oat.  It reminded me of family drives as a kid when we used to roll down the windows while passing the Quaker Oats factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Very inviting.<br /><br />Smell is not sufficient, so I had to eat this bag of goodies.  VERY impressed.  One thing I hate about a lot of granola (oat clusters) is that it's crumbled too much.  You end up with thousands of tiny chunks.  This is not true with the Kind brand.  There are big and small chunks, with the right texture and crunch.  Added to that is a simply delicious flavor; it's like health-food candy.  Each bite is like cheating a diet.  Delicious cinnamon flavoring without being overpowering.  I highly recommend it in milk as a healthy alternative to sugary cereals, or in handfuls while hiking through multi-colored forest landscapes that pleasantly make time disappear.\n",

      "First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really \"everlasting\" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y\">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a><br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are pretty neutral smelling, which is a plus for this line. I know dogs are all about the smell of things and the stinkier something is, the more they like them...but when you have to share the household with a dog, you need to find a happy medium. This is ours when company comes over. It has no real smell, but they aren't her favorite either.\n",

I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those. I have purchased Gentlease in different size cans and cases and am still using it with my twins.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.\n",

      "The Annie's product compares favorable to Kraft Mac & Cheese.<br /><br />I just can't let stand some mis-information comparing the two.<br /><br />One correction needed is \"I love mac and cheese and I know how to make it.  --  The cheese powder doesn't dissolve entirely, and it tends to stick to the pasta in dry little clumps rather than blend into an actual sauce.\"<br /><br />But if the preparation instructions are followed this is nearly impossible to happen.  On the other hand, if one were to improperly prepare the Annie's product (for example using the Kraft preparation instructions), then this is exactly what you could get - clumps!  The Annie product preparation instruction state to put 2-4 tablespoons of skim milk + the cheese sauce mix into the warm empty pot and wisk well until SMOOTH, and only then to add the cooked pasta into the pot.  Whereas, Kraft tells you to pour the dry cheese powder on top of the cooked pasta.<br /><br />As to the calories: \"Now hear this: Annie's has more and fat and calories than KRAFT.\"<br /><br />This is not true, again, if prepared according to the instructions.  Kraft is 380 calories 23% from fat whereas Annie's is only 290 calories 8% from fat.<br /><br />Note that Annie's obtains this by eliminating the need for butter. If someone were go and add the same amount of butter to the Annie's recommended preparation method, then the calories and fat count would be higher.  But this would be silly, since the Annie's cheese mix is blended to replace the need for the butter.<br /><br />Side note: Annie's does list an alternative higher fat preparation method using ½ the amount of butter as Kraft.  In this case the calories would be roughly 350 with 18% coming from fat, still a little less than found with Kraft.\n",

And you can make your own brown sugar by mixing a teaspoon into a half cup of white sugar.)<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this product five stars is because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the packaging doesn't hold up well in shipping. One of our orders had to be returned because it leaked out of the package and into the courier's truck. Another order leaked but at least stayed within the Amazon box.<br /><br />Since it's molasses, I'm going to guess that such leaks occur more often in hot summer months. It's still a great product, so winter might be a good time to stock up!\n",

      "I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.\n",

The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad).  They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen.  They're like \"hint of oreo\" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting).<br />I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice.  I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.  When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, \"well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos.\"\n",

      "About 5 years ago I discovered the \"secret\" to better baking -- parchment paper.  This little kitchen miracle worker makes baking so much easier and healthier.  No more having to grease cookie sheets or clean up the mess from a pecan pie that \"bubbled over\" when cooking.  A piece of parchment paper does the trick while keeping unecessary fats and calories out of your foods!<br /><br />The one problem with parchment paper is the variety you find in most stores is 1)  Expensive and 2)  bleached with chemicals.  \"If You Care\" has solved both of those problems in this 4-pack of parchment paper that your kitchen will love (hint:  it also makes a GREAT gift for a friend who is into cooking -- trust me!).  For the price you will pay for 4 boxes of this parchment paper you will get over 8 times as much as you would have gotten in the grocery store!  Plus you can rest easy knowing you aren't harming the environment by using paper that was bleached (can someone tell me what the purpose is to bleaching parchment paper -- it just seems silly!)<br /><br />I can't stop recommending this paper enough.  This is my 4th purchase from Amazon over the years of this exact same paper and while you may think that 4 boxes is a lot -- trust me, it will get used!  Once you discover how much easier it makes cooking you will be using it for everything!\n",

Many cereal manufacturers are not labeling peanut allergens, nor will they answer questions about them when you call.  Post would not help at all.  Then I learned of Enjoy Life and their Perky's cereals.  I really liked this one.  It has a slightly nutty flavor, stays crunchy in milk and when mixed in with yogurt.  It is dense not lite at all.  It has a good level of fiber and the flax makes it have good fats too!  Plus, no unhealthy sugars.  My kids like the flavor, but have problems with the size since they are little tiny balls.  This cereal is great when making treats though.  It works well with crispie type treats and cookies.  I am next going to try it as a pie crust for the pumpkin pie this season.  Amazon has a pretty good deal on the price as well.  It is $4 per box at my local market at least.  I'm saving about a $1 per box ordering here.  I will buy again!\n",

We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.\n",

It is so easy and I didn't feel like I was making separate food for my baby, but rather making him a part of what we were eating. The all-in-one is so perfect. Before I had to steam everything separately then transport into a blender or mixer (which are not designed to puree effectively) and then move again to jars/bowls/storage. Ugh..I felt like a short order cook. With the Baby Brezza, it was simple steps to great food. I also found that I used it for the rest of the family to make berry sauce for oatmeal, yogurt, pancakes, chicken and pork, homemade applesauce in a snap, great guacamole for the whole family and so much more. So if your fear is that \"this will just be another gadget in your cupboard\" after the baby becomes a toddler, don't worry.

      "I've used about 3 boxes of this brand and find it works well. I've had no problems -it clumps well. Tracking isn't too bad and it does a great job at containing odors. That being said, the scent of this litter is quite over powering. Although the scent itself isn't bad, it might be a problem for those with a sensitive nose or are picky.<br /><br />I look forward to trying the unscented version if I can ever find it in-store. I really do like the packaging of this brand. There is a pour spout at one edge that makes things a lot easier.<br /><br />Arm & Hammer is worth a try and tends to be cheaper than brands such as Tidy Cats.\n",

      "We bought this after my daughter started refusing liquid omega-3 cod liver oil.  It's OK- it's softer than a regular gummy and does taste about as much like candy as an oil can probably get.  I do not like the taste of it myself as it does have a subtle hint of fish taste in it, which is wierd in something that tastes otherwise like candy, but my daughter does not seem to notice the fish.  It is VERY subtle so I am not sure many kids would notice. I do not like that it only has about half the amount of omega 3 as a liquid, but if you are having trouble getting your child to take omega 3 liquids this might be a helpful solution.<br /><br />I had to edit this to say that after the second day my daughter started to refuse this, saying it is yucky.  She tasted one of the yellow ones on the second day and had to spit it out.  3 year olds can be very finicky. We're trying the nordic naturals strawberry flavor next, LOL!\n",

      "I have to admit up front that it has only been a week since my two cats have started eating this food exclusively.  I don't want to jinx it, but this food is amazing.  I have a 9-year old and a 13-year old, both with extremely sensitive stomachs and can never find food that works for both of them.  I've tried the super high-end natural food which was way too rich and greasy.  I've also tried the low- to mid-range food like Science Diet, Iams, Nutro, and Purina...all sensitive stomach formulas, all with the same result - puke everywhere.<br /><br />After trips to the vet, multiple food changes, trying wet food only diets, considering raw diets, I finally came upon Natural Balance Chicken and Pea formula.  It was on sale at Petco, and so I got a small bag thinking if it didn't work, at least it wasn't an expensive waste.  I was skeptical, but hopeful.  Day 1, no puke.  Day 2, no puke.  Days 3, 4, 5...NO PUKE!  I can't begin to tell you what a difference it has made!  The best part is that they both WANT to eat this food.  They will meow when their bowl is empty and get excited when they hear the kibbles hit the bowl.<br /><br />If you have kitties with sensitive stomachs and feel like you've tried everything, I really recommend giving this a shot.  It's very reasonably priced, has NO grains and is made for cats with allergies and sensitivies to fillers.  Give it a try!\n",

I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes I do get an odd aftertaste that I associate with decafs.  I don't taste it every time, so I wonder if it's because the K-cups get old?  We don't go through the decafs as fast as the regular.<br /><br />For those of you that know New Orleans coffee (with chicory), this is different.  No chicory, just good coffee.\n",

When I got it the first thing I did was read the ingredients and to my dismay, one of the things in this bag is Chickory Root extract.  :(  This is an ingredient that companies put into their products to bump the fiber content.  But in doing so it causes excess gas and bloating.  This is one of the key ingredients that I avoid when looking for healthy foods to buy.  I did taste the product and it is actually very good and if I didn't know it would upset my stomach I would really enjoy it.  I hope I can find something like this without Chickory root in it.  I would recommend it for the flavor if you don't care about that one ingredient.  (the same one used in all Fiber One products to make them so high in fiber)\n",

      "I purchased this product out of curiosity -- to see if it would work differently (or as well) in my homemade yogurt than the instant powdered milk. And oh, yes, there's a big, big difference -- in taste and consistency (in the liquid milk *and* the yogurt). Based on the cost of instant dry milk around here (GA), it's quite a bit less expensive too -- you use less of it to make a quart than with instant.<br /><br />While I've heard that this form of milk is harder to mix, I didn't find it that much different from reconstituting the instant version, except that I needed to use warm water instead of cold. I did have a first trial that gave, ahem, unexpected results. ((YMMV, of course -- but if you end up needing to use a whisk, and plan to use the milk for yogurt, you might get an interesting \"bubble effect\" texture in the finished product. :))<br /><br />On my next experiment, also with warm water (just under 120 degrees), a few rounds of patient (slow) spoon-stirring was all it seemed to take -- I just waited a minute in between stirings. In each case, adding the nearly-room-temperature starter-yogurt made the temperature just right for the yogurt-maker. (If you use warm water and plan to use the milk for drinking, you'll want to refrigerate until chilled -- in other words, plan ahead.)<br /><br />So again, the mixing process is a little different, but not that much different -- and the results are very much worth the little bit of extra care. To me, the chilled liquid tastes as good as regular milk from the store -- I didn't think I'd ever say that about powdered milk!<br /><br />Just a couple of downsides to mention, though they're minor:<br /><br />- I wish there were mixing directions on the package -- how much powder to use to how much water. But I eventually found ballpark directions on the Internet. I used about a cup of powder and a bit over 3 cups of water to make a quart of yogurt, but it turned out so thick, I'll probably try a little less next time.<br /><br />- While the product packaging doesn't say this, I suspect this form of milk is the kind without the added Vitamins A & D that most store milks have. I get plenty of these vitamins from other sources, so it's not a deal breaker for me. It might be for you.\n",

At first I wasn't sure if they were doing anything, but after about 3 or 4 days of them, I noticed that I wasn't getting hungry very much anymore and that it didn't take as much to get me full. It sort of takes the edge off of food for me, I never get as ravenous and have a much easier time being smart about my choices and eating less. I've lost about 4 pounds in that time frame, combined with a lot of workouts and eating smart when I do eat. I like to call them my liquid willpower. The subscription is the way to go on these, as my local stores are always sold out.<br /><br />I love the Neuro drinks because they are natural and gentle. The Sonic's are awesome, they give me the boost of energy and really help me focus without feeling jittery or having a terrible crash afterwards. The Sleep's are also awesome, they really do work, but I have to drink them slowly over an hour or so, otherwise they upset my stomach a little and I usually wake up having to go to the bathroom right when I fall asleep. The Gasms are also a lot of fun. ;)\n",

      "I am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...\n",

It's way weaker than KAL and takes 3-4x as much so even though I saved 50 percent I'll be wasting more money using more of the product. Oh well. I'll use it up and buy KAL again.\n",

      "Having tried & adored most of this brand's soup cups, I eagerly grabbed a cup of their lentil & couscous soup. Thirty minutes later, I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience.<br /><br />The soup may have less sodium, but it is incredibly bland tasting. It doesn't need salt, but a pinch of extra seasoning would have helped the taste. This may be great for some, but for me it would deter me from purchasing more of this product unless I were to get some extra seasoning to dump in it.<br /><br />The best part of the soup is that it is incredibly filling- even more so than some of McDougall's other products. It's just that I'd rather have something that tastes good rather than something that is filling. If you don't mind bland food or can season it to perfection, get this product. If you are like me & just don't have the time to season food at work, you may want to skip this & give their other products a try.<br /><br />*Oh, and I recommend letting this sit for 8 minutes rather than 5. It made the lentils & couscous much more tender!\n",

      "I'm a novice when it comes to Bonsai. I have purchased an elm and juniper and both arrived well packaged and healthy. Actually, the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap. And although I'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old. To my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger.<br /><br />The elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few Internet searches I learned why this is happening. The pots were as I expected and I believe them to be of nice quality. The box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which I wasn't expecting but it was nice and I appreciate it.<br /><br />I think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary brochure for Bonsai related products such as humidity trays. The reason I say this is because I am a novice and upon initially ordering I had no clue that such things were needed to help Bonsai thrive. At least with a complementary brochure I could have looked through it and say \"Hmm, what is a humidity tray for?\" and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner.<br /><br />I have had both Bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying. And considering this is Winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so I don't expect much activity until Spring.<br /><br />I would buy again from this seller.\n",

I did need to take about 8-10 capsules per day, and I did smell like maple syrup (fenugreek smells like maple and with such a high dose it does come out in your sweat), but it was worth it.

One can will barely feed two hungry men, though. ;)<br /><br />Lots of gravy with meat pieces, a bit more meat would be nice. The meat was fairly lean and tender and had good texture.

      "My husband and I have tried to change our eating habits this year and part of that has been making sure we have something for breakfast.  I don't know about everyone else, but we are not friends with our alarm clock.  We have a slap fight every morning with it until we realize we must obey if we want to keep our jobs.  Needless to say, there is no time for breakfast before we rush out the door.<br /><br />This is where these cookies come in very handy.  The first time we bought them we kept them in our pantry (I think we bought 60 that time to try a variety of flavors).  Unfortunately, by the time we reached the last dozen, they had gone bad and were a bit fuzzy.  Now this is actually a good thing!  Mold can't grow without moisture, so this tells you the cookies are moist!  Because they are all natural and are not made with preservatives, it is only reasonable that they would have a shorter shelf life.<br /><br />Next order we popped a weeks worth in the fridge and put the rest in the freezer.  We did this because my husband likes to eat them in morning traffic on his way to work so frozen cookies wouldn't work for him.  I on the other hand work in a very small office so I brought a variety to work and put them in our freezer.  In the morning I just pop one into the microwave for 45 seconds and I have a warm, tasty breakfast.  I especially like the gooeyness of the melted caramel and chocolate from those varieties.<br /><br />At an average of 300 calories it is a good meal alternative and is very filling.  It is a nice alternative to drinking a slim fast for breakfast, though I do sometimes still do Slimfast for breakfast and have a cookie for lunch.<br /><br />I would like to see them come in a variety dozen.<br /><br />[...]\n",

      "We've used Yoder's canned meats for several years, mainly for quick meals when we come home late from the ball field and everyone is hungry.  We also keep some on hand for emergencies since the meat is fully cooked and ready to eat without any lengthy preparations.  I like that the cans contain only meat and salt, no added ingredients or preservatives.  The liquid you find in the can is from the meat itself.  I especially like that the cans have a very long shelf life if kept at normal household temperatures.<br /><br />This variety pack is a great way to try canned meats and see for yourself how convenient and delicious they are.  One thing to remember is that the meat has been pressure cooked in the can, so it won't be all firm chunks when you use it.  It has recognizable chunks, but some of it will be more like shredded meat.  Each can contains 28 oz., which is plenty to feed a large family.<br /><br />The beef chunks are great in curries and chili.  I use the turkey and chicken in noodle casserole dishes, although the chicken also goes well in curry.  The pork makes an awesome pulled pork sandwich with the addition of BBQ sauce.  The pork sausage is wonderful in omelets, although I usually fry it a little and pour off the grease before adding eggs.  I do the same pre-cooking with the hamburger, since it does have a little fat in it.  After draining, I use the hamburger in dirty rice or spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />I can't recommend Yoder's canned meats enough - the wholesome ingredients, the convenience of having precooked, shelf stable meats, and the variety are well worth the cost.\n",

HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (spinach, mango, pears) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with green beans AND peas, you would think the color would be closer to a light green rather than just pear. but in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!\n",

      "Newton's Fruit Thins have bits of dried fruit instead of a fruit filling.  The packaging is great since the bag reseals with fold-over ties.  The cookie is very tasty and moderately nutritious considering it is a cookie.  It comes with 2 gms of fiber in each serving and the Carbohydrate to sugar ratio is a very reasonable 3:1.  While I did expect more fruit, I would seriously consider buying this product.  Since I am always on the hunt for nutritious snacks for the family, this would probably meet my needs and those of the grandkids for great taste.\n",

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.\n",

I was disappointed with the Santa's House & Toy Shop. I bought two kits and both had broken pieces that I had to glue together before I could even begin to assemble them, not to mention the candy canes that were obviously broken before they were even packed in the kit.  Also, the pre-printed sides were backwards, leaving me to have one rough side exposed with the windows facing inward. I guess I was spoiled with the previous kits I've bought, never a problem with any of them. I usually buy three kits every year. I assemble them before Thanksgiving and as part of our Thanksgiving day tradition my three grandchildren decorate them.<br />Regardless of the quality of the kit, the kids enjoyed them which is all that<br />really matters.\n",

I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.

      "Our 9 year old was recently diagnosed as celiac and we suspect she may not be the only one in our family with the 'wheat issue'.  My 9 year old loves to eat bread and milk and, of course, now she can't have either.  I knew there were gluten-free flours and breads out there, but they're not easy to find in my local grocery store.  I went online to Amazon Grocery to see if they offered anything and to see what customers' reviews were.  I wanted to try something that others had enjoyed, not just buy whatever (few) items they happened to carry in town. This bread mix was very highly rated, so I bought a whole case to give it a try.<br /><br />I received a bread machine from my mother that wasn't a special 'gluten-free' type bread machine, so I gave this bread mix a try using the standard method.  It took some adjusting to get the best ingredient combination to yield the right taste and texture, but this formula is a winner!  The instructions on the box call for either milk or water, butter or oil, and several types of egg combinations.  The best tasting (and texture) combination was milk, olive oil and 2 large (whole) eggs.  The smell of the freshly baked bread brings the whole family out of hiding and into the kitchen, salivating as I slice into the warm loaf.<br /><br />Celiacs need not despair!!!  This gluten-free bread mix makes the most delicious bread that's so good it's hard to believe it's not traditional wheat bread.  It also takes the hassle out of trying to purchase and concoct a wheat-flour substitute that can be used to THEN make bread that anyone accustomed to wheat bread might actually want to eat.  Our whole family LOVES this bread.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!\n",

      "I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar. Most foods that advertise themselves as a \"healthy\" snack are not really all that good for you. Often they are too high in calories or they use products that you just shouldn't eat. This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG. They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber. (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)<br /><br />The chips are delicious. They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip. The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat. I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip. I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out. I tried the Buffalo flavor and they have a very mild kick; much milder than I expected. I still like them, but not as much as the plain.  I really enjoy eating the Multigrain with a little lowfat queso!\n",

I've tasted some wasabi peas that are so hard that you feel like you might break or chip a tooth.<br /><br />These have a great bite to them.  They can clear your sinuses in any particular mouthful, and they keep me coming back for more.  I can easily eat a whole bag in one sitting, but typically, I get 3-4 servings out of a bag.  What can I say, I love wasabi peas.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like about these (and most wasabi peas) is that they are artificially colored.  I would be fine with these peas if they didn't have any coloring to make them seem \"fresh\".  Wasabi peas are wasabi peas... they don't have to look like they were fresh green peas with some wasabi slapped on them.  I'd love to find the Good Sense brand's wasabi peas without the artificial coloring.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase another case (pack of 12) of these particular wasabi peas when I run out, but I am still open to trying new brands (and there are a good number of brands that make them).\n",

I broiled the salmon and it tasted amazing.  The coconut oil definitely enhanced the flavor.<br />I have been using this oil for frying eggs as well.  It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.<br />This coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.<br />It's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.<br />I combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.<br />It has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.<br /><br />April 19, 2012<br /><br />Still loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.<br />I packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.<br />It also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.

It took me awhile to get used to the taste--at first I thought it was a little chalky, but now I love it and would NEVER go back to the cruddy stuff. The worst part about this stuff is that I tend to eat it straight out of the jar....:).<br /><br />Hints:<br />-When you get first get it, store the jar upside-down for awhile. When you're ready to eat it, turn it over and all the oil will be on the bottom. It's much easier to stir it this way than when the oil is on top.<br />-MAKE SURE you store it in the refrigerator after it is opened. Natural peanut butter, being natural, HAS to go in there otherwise it will go bad very quickly.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

My dog hasn't choked yet, but the last little bit of beef hide becomes lodged at the back of her jaw so and she starts licking/thrusting her tongue to dislodge it...and that's when I have to reach into the back of her throat and pull it out.

I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day.

      "My cats have eaten Evo dry for several years, and I've always taken pride in their energy and shiny coats. Sometime last year, however, I watched my large male cat's health start to decline. He lost muscle mass, whiskers, and his coat was growing duller. Much more alarmingly, his nose began running and he began to have occasional seizures.<br /><br />After tests at the vet ruled out any obvious problems, I switched him over to a high-quality canned food and began supplementing taurine. It's too early to say if this is the end of his troubles, but his health has visibly improved.<br /><br />If you ever see your cat begin to suffer and do any reading on nutrition, you will quickly learn that virtually every respected unbiased cat authority strongly recommends that cats be fed a quality canned food. Now, my cats adore Evo dry. Clearly, it's a good product and I hoped it would be a fine substitute for canned, given the convenience factor, but it appears that even grain-free dry food isn't enough, at least for some large, active and muscular cats.\n",

      "The 60's decade box was well received and everyone enjoyed a trip down memory lane although a good portion of the products were unfamiliar not only to those raised in the 60's, but those older and younger.  Many were wondering if they were east coast products.  The price of the product for what was received was quite excessive, and the cost of the cheapest shipping was astronomical (almost as much as the product).  The box is cute, but some of the individual candy packages arrived opened with contents spilled and broken because it wasn't packaged for shipping.  Luckily I opened the box before presenting it as everything was piled together into a big heap.  I was quite surprised that there wasn't any box filler (stryofoam peanuts, bubble wrap or shredded colored paper) or that the items weren't arranged for giving.  I added my own shredded colored paper and arranged the items, but really felt for the price that it should have been professionally presented.<br /><br />Although a neat idea, I will not purchase any more of these decade boxes from this company for the reasons stated above.  I recently saw a similar item by another company that had just as many candies and was priced less than $15.\n",

      "So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a \"spice flavor not found in nature,\" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS\">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

      "I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this.  And I hesitated and hesitated...  But, I'm glad I finally got this!  This tastes delicious and it was so easy.<br /><br />You get 6 individually packaged boxes and each package has the directions. The packages contain one foil packet of the paste.  I first melted the butter with the water and then mixed the paste in. Then I added the chicken and cooked until ready.  That's it!  It was really all I did and it came out great.  The smell in the house while this is cooking was heavenly.<br /><br />I used a little less butter than the recipe asked for and it still turned out delicious.  We served this over rice and we really enjoyed it.<br /><br />There is also a Microwave Oven recipe for those folks that don't have a stove or would rather use the Microwave.<br /><br />The expiration dates on these were all well out into late next year, so I have plenty of time to use these.  But, there is no way they are going to last that long.  I'm sure I'll use these all up in the next month or so.<br /><br />Because of the great success with this item, I ordered some of the other items from this line.  I'm eager to test them out and see if they are as wonderful as this one.<br /><br />I have always wanted to make a tasty Indian dish at home and just didn't know how to go about it.  I'm so glad I found these.  Big taste.  And big money saver versus going to my local Indian restaurant.\n",

      "I've been using this tuna for many months, buying it here on Amazon, and it has always been excellent! I've given away a few cans to friends and co-workers without mentioning anything, and all of them have came back and asked me for more info about it. It is simply the best tuna I've ever had by far!<br /><br />Read the labels and research yourself where your tuna is coming from, and how it is processed. I don't know of any tuna that is completely wild, line caught in the US and hand selected in the 17 lb size, and cooked in the can with no water added. Any liquid in the can are Omega 3 oils, so do NOT drain the liquid! The oils mix together very good with the tuna by itself, or in to a salad. It's like an anti-freeze for the blood, in addition to benefits.<br /><br />Most tuna comes from Asia, or elsewhere overseas, and much of it is wild tuna, caught and kept in pens, and fed by humans to fatten them up. Animal Planet uses sushi-grade line caught tuna, hand selected in the smaller sizes (called \"peanut size\" to the sport fishing crowd). And the sushi-grade means caught, immediately bled, and put on ice. Ask any sport fisherman, they all know this is the only method to use to ensure good tasting tuna. You will not have sushi-grade tuna unless you do this process, and quickly. It's the KEY to great tasting tuna. Having had wild caught sport albacore locally, and being involved with the sport fishing group, I have learned this. Check out other brands and then read about Wild Planet, and then make the taste taste. I highly recommend this stuff.\n",

      "I use this as a hair and scalp oil.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp,  If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none.  Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny.  A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed.  Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue.<br /><br />I started using it because my mom has uses it.  But, I never knew much about it.  I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate \"liver spots\"  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few \"liver\" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,\n",

As good as that might sound, you have to look deeper at this box and the product inside.<br /><br />I prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box.  Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings, this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people.  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us, it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.<br /><br />The taste was basically tasteless. We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly.  It was salty but not cheesy.  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.<br /><br />I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier.  My family would eat it and be better pleased as well.  No one liked it in my household.\n",

      "I've been using mole traps of this kind for over 50 years and have killed many hundreds of moles.  I have used Victor traps and cheaper traps.  They all kill moles but I prefer Victor because of the design.  The \"legs\" that hold the trap in the ground have barbs on them to keep the trap from jumping out of the ground when the trap is triggered.  The trap is made from heavy guage steel and the spikes are heavy guage and very sharp.  The spikes are sharpened diagonally on the tips so they cut like a knife.  The trap is easy to set.....takes just a couple minutes, just follow the simple directions.  If people are missing moles with this trap, it is probably because they are not setting the trap in deep enough or are not making sure the spikes can travel freely down into the ground when the trap is sprung.  A couple of tips:  After locating the run, step on a spot to flatten the run, then set the trap to straddle the flattened run.  Push the \"legs\" of the trap into the dirt as far as they will go until the trigger touches the flattened part of the run that you stepped on.  Then (important)before you set the tripping mechanism, push the spikes up and down through the dirt a few times until they travel freely.  I have caught several moles this week and will get another one this evening.  This mole trap is well-made (in USA), easy to use and will definitely kill moles if it is set correctly.  I have 9 traps and set them in clusters but you can kill many moles with just one trap...........it just takes longer.\n",

They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to \"double brew\" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.\n",

I've been looking into ordering Quinoa for years, hopefully the world is finally learning that this is the new super-food, and thankfully I can now finally order it at reasonable prices fairly easily too, so I gave this bag a try. The red because it tastes better according to the critics, and well quite frankly, everything I have read about it is true. It tastes like nuts, is a little crunchy, and the seeds pop when you cook it turning into little snail looking bead sprouts. It is a lot smaller than I expected, but slightly more than doubles in size when you cook it. It was a lot easier to cook than rice which clumps together too easily. Because of the nutty taste I can even eat Quinoa as is, nothing added, something I would never do with rice, and Quinoa because of the high nutrient content makes a completely healthy meal all by itself! Heads up though, WASH IT SEVERAL TIMES IF IT SAYS WASH ON THE BAG. It is not like rice that you wash just to get rid of the dusty powder. If you don't wash Quinoa well before you eat it, then it will taste very acidic like putting a penny in your mouth at first. I really like this stuff and will eat it all until it's gone.\n",

Long after the filling is gone they still gnaw on the bones with delight.<br /><br />Makes me happy that these are made in the USA. I think these are great. Try them out for your pup!\n",

      "The packaging of this spice is superior to other packaging methods I've experienced.  The color is vibrant and aroma excellent.  I've used this in rice dishes so far and plan to develop more ways to get it in my family's diet.  I've seen on many sites and in other reviews advice to use turmeric with oil (olive oil would probably be ideal) to aid absorption.  Absorption is the goal because this isn't just food; it's medicinal.<br /><br />The active ingredient is curcumin.  This product claims at least 5% curcumin.  Turmeric typically has a range of curcumin between 2% - 6%.  Curcumin is responsible for the dramatic and many health effects of this spice.  It helps against inflammation, diarrhea, arthritis and a lot more.  The one getting a lot of attention now is to aid against the prevention of Alzheimer disease.  There are studies on this so it's not official yet.  I guess it's semi-official if you think about all the doctors behind this movement and some statistics about populations that use turmeric.<br /><br />The spice is agreeable in many dishes in combination with other flavors.\n",

I always forget to look for food on amazon but it struck me and after a quick search I found the Zoe.<br />This olive oil is a good value for the quality and quantity you receive.  Its got a nice darker color and olive flavor.  This will be my everyday oil to use in pans, cooking, and even a fast salad if I dont feel like taking out the expensive stuff.\n",

I especially enjoy it mixed in my morning oatmeal and my little dog considers it a real treat.<br /><br />I was leery of purchasing this product because of the some of the negative reviews so after opening my first can of Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin, I felt obliged to do a review.<br /><br />I am so glad that I ignored the negative reviews.  I happened to have a can of Libby's pumpkin puree (my usual brand) already open so it was easy to do a comparison.  The Farmer's Market pumpkin seemed a little creamier and the color was very similar but perhaps just a shade less bright.  To my palate, it seemed to have a slightly earthier taste, more like sweet potato but when I added cinnamon and sweetener, it was impossible to detect a difference.<br /><br />None of the cans were dented and the expiration date of October 2013 is almost three years in the future.  I am very happy with this purchase and delighted that it is offered on subscribe and save since pumpkin puree is not something all grocery stores routinely stock in the off season.\n",

      "I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you.  I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.  I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.\n",

      "We used this for Pancakes Christmas morning. Personally I did not like the bean flour at first, I thought it tasted like soap. My non-gluten-free family, however, LOVED it and *insisted* I use it from now on. They said it was not as gritty as rice flour and had the texture of \"real\" bread. As for the taste, they didn't know what I was talking about. They loved it.<br /><br />I tried this one again, and snuck some into cookies, then tried the Bob's Red Mill GF Chocolate Cake mix with the bean flour, and it's grown on me. I stand corrected and I am actually kicking myself for not allowing myself to grow a taste for it sooner.<br /><br />It's opened a new world of Gluten free baking for me just when I thought I had it all together with the rice flour.<br />I have gone back now and looked at my \"Gluten Free Gourmet\" book and have a new eye for the recipes requiring bean flour.<br /><br />It took our stomachs minimal time getting used to the beans, if you catch my drift, but after the first few batches of baked goods (about 3 in a week) we have adjusted.<br /><br />We feel better after using this mix because of the fiber and protein, as opposed to all that starch and empty carbs of the the white rice flour. I don't have to pass round the laxative anymore (a common reality of switching to the GF diet.)<br /><br />Make some pancakes (2 cups of the flour mix, 1 tsp baking soda, an egg, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 tsp xantham gum--thin with water or milk to desired consistency)and ease yourself into it with butter and syrup.  Of course the flour smells like beans (duh), but the flavor of the beans is mild after it has been cooked.\n",

I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.\n",

I fell in love with Leonidas chocolates the first time I tasted them in Belgium and would look the world over for a box if I couldn't find them here. If you are looking for the best chocolates in the world, you just found them!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Blueberry Toaster Pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. They heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. I'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "I only recently started cooking steaks on a cast-iron skillet and I'm not sure I want to cook future steaks any other way!<br /><br />Well, when you go down this road, you will quickly learn that olive oil, canola oil, have relatively low smoke points.  A smoke point is the highest temperature you can heat your oil before your smoke detector goes off. ;-)<br /><br />Olive oil is around 325 deg.F.  Avocado oil is the highest at 520 deg.F. !<br /><br />Now I still produce smoke, but nothing like before.  The only downside of searing steaks in a super heated cast iron skillet was the smoke produced, now I can lessen the smoke and enjoy some amazing steaks.  Win/Win! Oh and as I understand it, avocado oil has less saturated fats than even olive oil, but I'm sure eating all this extra red meat doesn't really help. :-P\n",

      "I took this product in my iced tea every day after eating something (without eating something first, I got a bad stomach ache and nausea) and the taste was very palatable (with three packets of Stevia in the tea to kind of cover the veggie taste).  After almost two weeks, I noticed I was extremely lethargic - even after ten to twelve hours of sleep - and couldn't think clearly.  I had completely forgotten that years ago I had these same symptoms due to taking a multivitamin with iron in it.  Blood tests at the time showed I had way too much iron in my blood.  I didn't think the 10% iron in this product would bother me but it did.  I stopped taking it a week ago and I guess will just ride things out until my blood levels normalize. I gave the product a high rating because its not the product's fault that I wasn't paying attention to the iron level within it.  If my system didn't retain so much iron, this product would probably have really helped me!\n",

It is (naturally) more expensive, but the results will justify the expense.  This is a moist, rich sugar with strong molasses flavor.  It will spoil you forever.<br /><br />I am accustomed to spending $3.00+ for this, so if you bake with any regularity, splurge on this package, store it tightly sealed in a cool place (not refrigerated) and enjoy it.  In molasses cookies, this is unparalleled.\n",

      "I had been struggling to find a way to give my cat with hyperthyroidism her medication twice daily.  I had tried all sorts of other things (american cheese, cream cheese, bread, etc) to wrap her pills in, but she always managed to spit them out.  This product has been a godsend!  Prior to finding this product, my cat had started to become anti-social, probably due to the fact that every time I managed to track her down she was being traumatized by being pinned down and having a pill shoved down her throat... now, if I am not right on time when it comes to giving her a pill, she is the one who lets me know now by meowing and making noise until she gets her pill.<br /><br />One suggestion... if your cat is not accustomed to receiving treats, I would introduce them to treats for about a week or two before introducing these.  My cat was skeptical of treats, because she never got them, so I started giving her Temptations cat treats about two weeks before starting the pill pockets.  It got her used to the idea of receiving treats daily, and after a short amount of time she was gobbling the treats without even chewing.  Made it much easier when I introduced her to the pill pockets - she ended up just gobbling those down too without chewing, so she doesn't even notice there is a pill buried inside.  Without this product, giving my cat her medication would be a daily battle - instead this product has made it a pleasure to give my cat her medication!\n",

      "My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).<br />to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations.\n",
