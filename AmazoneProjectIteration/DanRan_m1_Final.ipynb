      "The price per bag is more expensive but you feed your dog much less because there is no grain in the food. Therefore, the price per day is much less than common middle of the road dog foods like science diet. Here is how I figured it out:<br /><br />My dog:<br />40 lb. Border collie, 4 years old, energetic and healthy, been fed Evo his entire life<br /><br />Food serving size per day based on manufacturers recommendations:<br />According to Science Diet - 3 cups or 295 grams per day.<br />Evo - 1 7/8 cups or 226 grams per day.<br /><br />Cost:<br />Science Diet Adult Fitness: $44.39 / 35 lb. bag or 15,875.73 grams.<br />Evo Red Meat Small Bites: $ 61.99 / 28.6 lb. bag or 12,972.74 grams.<br /><br />At the recommended serving size each bag of dog food will last for:<br />(Grams per bag / daily serving size)<br />Science Diet - 53.8 days.<br />Evo - 57.4 days.<br /><br />Cost per day to feed dog.<br />(Bag of food cost / total number of days a bag of food will last)<br />Evo Daily Cost - $0.93 per day.<br />Science Diet - $1.21 per day.<br /><br />Evo representatives have recommended switching between the salmon, chicken. My dog likes all of them it just makes sense because humans are not supposed to eat the exact same thing every day either.<br /><br />Pros:<br />My dog is healthy<br />Has no allergies to any ingredients (has allergies to other things like pollen)<br />He like the taste of all three types of Evo food. (salmon, chicken, red meat)<br />Not overweight<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't think of any other than his poop smells awful... I assume from the protein.\n",

It's simply divine.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE: Each pouch is individually wrapped to preserve the aromatics, and the drink is steeped like tea, so there is no need for a press or coffee maker.<br /><br />ECO Friendly:  The coffee is 100% organic and fair trade. What's not to love about that?<br /><br />CHARITABLE: A portion of the proceeds of this beverage go to charity to promote youth soccer programs<br /><br />All in all this is a delicious, convenient yummy beverage and a new favorite in our home!<br /><br />Our other favorite is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027CNY7U\">Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea Bags, 75-count</a>\n",

      "Like other reviewers, we are extremely grateful to GF Harvest for bringing organic, gluten-free oats to market. We have now gotten three shipments of their oats. Our first two orders were not for rolled oats, but for organic GF Oat Groats, which we purchased directly from the GF Harvest website. Since we are lucky enough to have a grain mill and an oat roller/flaker, we were able to make our own rolled oats, oat flour, and even some crumbled oats (that we liked to pretend were steel-cut). The results: possibly the best-tasting oats that we've ever had, GF or not, crumbled or not. Creamy, sweet, and fresh. In the past, we had used GF oat groats purchased from Cream Hill Estates and Gifts of Nature, but these were mediocre. We have also consumed tons of GF steel-cut and rolled oats from Bob's Red Mill, as well as McCann's, but these were also nowhere near as good as the rolled and/or crumbled oats we made from the GF Harvest groats. Unfortunately, the GF Harvest organic rolled oats are also nowhere near as good as the GF Harvest groats. They just don't have the same fresh, sweet taste that we got from the  oat groats. Also, these are not, as the label claims, \"Old Fashioned\" rolled oats. Flakes as thin as these should really be labeled \"quick\" oats (which are bound to lose both flavor and nutritional value, simply because of their thinness). We hope that GF Harvest begins to produce true \"thick\" rolled or steel-cut organic GF oats (BRM produces both \"thick\" and \"quick\" GF rolled oats, which, unfortunately, are not organic). Either \"thick\" oats or steel-cut would do a much better job of retaining the flavor and nutrition of the groats. In the meantime, GF Harvest should really correct the labeling on these rolled oats to reflect the fact that they're actually \"quick\"  rather than \"old fashioned\".\n",

      "I have made macaroni and cheese using this pasta several times and am now hooked.  One thing I must say is that it is IMPERATIVE that the water for the pasta be in a full boil before adding the pasta to the water -- otherwise you end up with a slimy slush.  Other than that, the only other things to worry about are a)overcooking and b)overeating.<br /><br />For leftovers, the pasta dish must be covered and thoroughly reheated until very hot, else the pasta will be leathery.  If you find the reheated pasta is like leather, you just need to cover and microwave a little longer.<br /><br />IMO this pasta tastes *better* than non GF versions -- and it had better, given the price, right?  Even so, I've taken off one star for the price because these are SO much more expensive than the non GF version (which can be purchased for 1/3 the price per unit...as in 99 cents).  However perhaps this might explain the expense -- the box containing the bags of pasta was marked \"Product of Italy\".\n",

After breaking it in half, I gave my Jack Russell/ Chihuahua half of it, 20 minutes later, she is still tossing it around my living room, chasing it, and running from it. I think that she thinks it is a toy, because she cannot chew it. So unless your dog has shark teeth, I am not sure he or she would be able to eat these. Only 3 dollars, but I learned my lesson with these. We have used many other treats with her, and she has never had a problem before, impossible to train your dog with these, because they cannot chew them.\n",

This coffee has a slightly watery flavor, with rather little coffee flavor. Its fat and calorie contents are pretty low (1.5 grams per can and 100 calories per can).<br /><br />I would probably not purchase this again as I did not like it enough to spend money on it.<br /><br />This will never substitute for a real handmade cappuccino, but might do the trick when you have no time to get to your favorite coffee shop.<br /><br />Just don't tell anyone.\n",

That is, if you chew it up, it's pretty much tasteless until it melts in your mouth.  At that point, however, it's just too bitter for me.  I made a chocolate sauce with cream and a little sugar and it was wonderful over ice cream, and even just plain (the little bit of sugar cuts the bitterness a lot).  By the way, be prepared to chop the pieces.  As is, they are a little large for anything, unless you're just going to melt them in a double boiler.\n",

Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it.\n",

Made in the USA means that beef was turned into jerky in the USA, not the cattle were necessarily raised in the USA, though they might have been. But the real complaint is the flavor, which seems to be the taste of preservative and MSG with some hard-to-identify spice and unconvincing hickory flavor. This is a relatively dry jerky which you have to chew -- but that's a good thing in my view since that's how \"real\" jerky is. But \"real\" jerky isn't overcome with preservatives and enhancers.\n",

And they sure have snap, they're very crunchy.<br /><br />I'm taking a point off because I think they go overboard on both accounts.  The lingering burn seems a bit excessive, although some might really enjoy it.

My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him.  When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits.  However, the plants just grew and grew.  They became overly bushy and never produced any beans.  I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes.  This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again.\n",

      "I ABSOLUTELY love this product, so when I saw that there were 1 and 2 star reviews, I had to write a review for myself. As a first time mom, I had high hopes of making my baby's own baby food, but once I returned to work, I felt as though I wouldn't have the time. Then a coworker recommended the Beaba to me, and I am so glad he did. It is a bit pricey, so I bought a used one, and as one reviewer pointed out, the water reserve did have some brown stuff in it. In order to clean the reserve, I used hot water and a toothbrush and scrubbed it all out. I have NEVER seen any of the brown get into the water after the steaming. Since I bought the item used, it didn't come with the manual, but it is so easy to use, that I didn't need one! After my first use, I was in love. For a full time working mom, this steamer blender makes me feel as though I was able to slave away in the kitchen all day to make the best possible food for my baby. Carrots and potatoes only take about 20 mins to steam, and then maybe 2 mins to blend up, so to all the people who say that it isn't big enough, how much food do you need to make?! I am able to make over 12 ounces at a time. Besides, this means that I can change it up for my little one so she doesn't have to eat the same thing day in and day out. And for all the naysayers out there saying that you get the same results with a blender and steamer, you're right. But you can wash dishes by hand too, or use the dishwasher! To all those on the fence about this product, BUY IT! [...].\n",

However, after buying another I have to say I think this tastes pretty good a bit sweet, but I will get into that later.<br /><br />Those saying it tastes like diluted Coconut Water, well obviously if you would actually read the bottle it contains: 10% Coconut Water...  Not only that, it's concentrated and guess what it's printed right on the bottle!  No way you say?  Yes way, read folks your concept and debate went out the window comparing it to 100% REAL coconut water.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*Contains Sodium, Potassium and Sea Salt all three are a huge plus ^_^.  These 3 act as electrolytes which we all know by now, help you stay hydrated!  Even drinking a ton of water throughout the day I still feel a bit dehydrated.  After drinking 1 bottle of this I feel satisfied battling dehydration to nothing!<br /><br />*Introduces you to Coconut Water! (I myself am one of those people who likes to get the real thing after experiencing a diluted form of said beverage or food.)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />*It is sweet, it has about 5 Tablespoons of Sugar and Stevia Extract making the flavor come out more than usual.  Unfortunately I have to ding a star for this as well, it does taste sweet as people have already stated and I feel they could minimize the sweetness if they lowered the amount of overall sugar.  Stevia is 300 times sweeter than sugar, so really the use of sugar should be pretty low.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />To sum it all up, if you want something that tastes of coconut and keeps you hydrated go for this.  In my opinion it tastes good!\n",

      "Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is certainly one of the most sinful of foods but, oh my gosh, is it delicious! It is a very rich but very flavorful coconut cream made from certified organic dried coconut meat from the Philippines. (I live in southwest Florida and room temperature here is just perfect for ensuring a very spreadable coconut cream).<br /><br />When I first opened the jar the fresh fragrance of coconut made my mouth water! Just like a kid, I could not resist sticking my finger into the jar and taking a big, generous taste. My taste buds simply exploded when the unique flavor of this decadent coconut cream melted on my tongue like sweet butter! And just like a kid, I know I will be tempted to take those sinful dips into the luscious coconut manna jar.<br /><br />I have noticed other reviewers' comments about the \"grittiness\" of this product and I just want to point out that coconut meat is a high fiber food and coconut manna is 100% whole coconut, so the texture is much like one should expect in a high fiber spread. Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna contains 12% fiber and 9% protein, whereas coconut oil contains none.<br /><br />Coconut in general is such a versatile food with an extraordinary taste and all manner of health benefits. In Sanskrit, the coconut palm is called \"kalpa vriska\" meaning \"the tree that supplies all that is needed to live.\" But I must be frank...I do not think Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna or any coconut product should be used as a food therapy for any health purpose. Coconut meat is nearly all fat, 80% of which is saturated. With that said, as difficult as it will probably be, I will be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna only sparingly (but with utter enjoyment!)<br /><br />Being a raw vegan foodie and with the holidays quickly approaching, I do look forward to getting creative with Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna and devising culinary applications with it, such as in my raw, vegan spreads, soups, smoothies, sauces, cheeses, and especially in desserts. Of course I will have to consider it a celebration food because of the high saturated fat content. This luscious treat is not the best choice for health or waistline but it is so good to the palate! I will definitely be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna for special occasions, for entertaining and for those times of private indulgence when I need to treat myself... and I will do so with wild abandon!\n",

It smelled funny in a bad way.  It wasn't a floral scent at all.  Honestly, I didn't  use it because I didn't want to end up wasting more expensive ingredients test-driving the product. The lime extract smelled like lime and tasted like lime (barely), and the orange smelled orangy and tasted like orange (somewhat), and since this extract smelled unpleasant, I extrapolated that the resulting icing would taste unpleasant as well.  I did some reading on rose oils and rose extract, and rose oil is recommended for flavoring, and rose oil, the truly good stuff, will be expensive.  (All this was for my annual Christmas cookie making fiesta, so I'll pop for and try to rose oil this coming holiday season.)\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "So my wife and I wanted to make baby food for our wee lass. We started out excited about the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQCOIS\">Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker</a> and after reading the reviews and getting our hands on it we changed our mind. Simply put there are three BIG problems.<br />1. It is hard to keep clean especially the reservoir.<br />2. It has a limited lifespan since all it makes is baby food.<br />3. It is very expensive for what you get.<br />Since we were free of the Bebycook we now had some money to spend so I bought a beautiful <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KQ66VY\">Mauviel M'Cook 5 Ply Stainless Steel 8 Inch Steamer Insert</a> to cook her food in. Then I bought a restaurant quality 1-quart \"Mouli Food Mill\" made by L. Tellier to puree her food in. Finally I use the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027UYT4O\">Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Green</a> freezer tray to store her food. Believe it or not the Beaba Babycook cost the same as a Mauviel steamer and a LT Mouli food mill combined, both of which are top of the line dishwasher-safe 18/10 stainless steel cooking masterpieces made in France. After your little one starts eating 'real' food the Beabe Babycook is just a hard to clean useless plastic paperweight made in China. But the steamer and the mouli are both essential kitchen tools that will last a lifetime of steaming broccoli and making home-made apple sauce. Yum...\n",

In this small espresso shot style it is probably the most adult as well, and it is nice to have a coffee drink that doesn't includ such extraneous ingredients as guarana or ginseng, etc...\n",

      "I've been eating Healthy Choice soup for several years, but it's getting harder to find in markets now.  They only seem to stock soups from this company in those microwaveable bowls, which I don't need.  Those bowls also cost more than the cans.  My 2 favorite flavors are the Split Pea & Ham and the Bean & Ham.  I'm thrilled that I can buy them by the case from Amazon.  These soups are very hearty & relatively low in sodium which I have to be careful of.  They taste as good as homemade which is almost unheard of in a canned soup.  I highly recommend this flavor and the Bean & Ham.\n",

The bag of 500 was a much better deal than the tub of 150 lollipops.<br /><br />Was I in for a surprise!  These lollipops are very tasty!  I sometimes have a sweet tooth and these also slow down how much sugar I have... because I eat only one at a time... not like cramming a candy bar or two down quickly. Reminds me of the picking the old penny/nickel candies by what would last the longest. :)<br /><br />These get my 5 star recommendation. I had an even assortment of many different varieties in my bag... anything orange or yellow was in short supply.  Flavors are delicious!  I'd recommend these for anyone with a family... a sweet in the lunch box... a treat anytime!  Instead of a cookie jar, or in addition to, you could also have a lollipop jar. :)\n",

      "Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews on the t-bag version of this item (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR14WO\">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a>), many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.) But for godssake, try the small size before buying 1 lb of it!<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there was more pu-erh itself than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces). When I peak inside the bag I really see more pieces of this and that than tea (and chocolate + orange should never cost $43/pound; this is what it comes down to). This works better for re-steepings than the t-bags, but it doesn't go as far as most cooked pu-erhs.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals \"eeew\". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor just wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I mix it with regular pu-erh! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I\">Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha works beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the super yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!\n",

      "I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I \"transitioned\" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of \"transitioning\" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.\n",

      "as early as i can remember when going to italy, everyone i would visit would be cooking on the stove a pot of Lavazza Creme e Gusto.<br /><br />I was tickled to see that i could start getting this through amazon's subscribe & save.  Best deal on the internet!<br /><br />knock on wood, i've been doing this for over a year and not 1 shipment has ever been messed up.  The only way i would recommend something different is if you have a pressure brewer.  Lavazza has a brew just for that.<br /><br />I know that the Lavazza Qualita Rossa is their higher \"quality\" roast but i just can't taste it.  I dont think its bad but not better than Creme & Creme is cheaper.<br /><br />I keep the open pack in the fridge & the sealed packs in the freezer.  No arguments from my local spanish family or friends who makes a mean cup of espresso.  using ice cold spring water helps too ;)<br /><br />i use Bialetti Moka Express stove top & electric pots to brew my espresso\n",

      "*****<br /><br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent \"natural flavors\" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague \"natural flavors\" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, \"The Reincarnation of Tea\". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some \"natural flavors\" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these \"natural flavors\" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor.\" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as \"grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"vegetative, popcorn\".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br /><br />*****\n",

      "I recently decided to jump on the bandwagon and give cake balls a whirl for a July 4th Party I was having. I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking. Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com! Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product \"meltage\" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs)<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R92\">5 LBS. Merckens White Coatings</a> and Blue (1 lb.) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00085F7S2\">1LB. Merckens Blue Coatings</a> Candy Coating. To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker! A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R9W\">1LB. Merckens Yellow Coatings</a> and Paramount crystals <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012A2FVY\">Paramont Crystals, 1 lb.</a>  , along with a couple other items. This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it \"fowl'?). I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say \"It's as hot as Corn Liquor!\" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note those of you who remove stars based on issues irrelevant to the item itself, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based things that don't speak to the product...such as shipping speed, poor customer service or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the \"back-story\" out of the way...the actual review! I set about making chocolate cake balls to make a r/w/b flag and some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain, to put on a stick, coated and decorated with sprinkles. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular \"dip-fest\" as it were. Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest method...I melted some white almond bark (I'd used almond bark in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts. Of the 4, the Mercken's was the \"winner\" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste. I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it \"setting up\" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary. The Almond Bark was the least expensive, slightly more difficult to work with for this project, not real white, very yummy. Mercken's is available in many colors, is readily available (in Dallas), is less $ than Mercken's and certainly the Ghirardelli, but not quite a smooth and a tad more difficult to work with.<br /><br />Since this review is for the yellow coating, I wanted to mention you might consider purchasing a large quantity of the white candy coating, since it can be purchased in 5 lb. bags, and just use Candy Food Coloring <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FWVX\">Wilton Primary Candy Color Set</a> to tint it to a shade you like.  Regular food coloring does not work...it must be specifically for candy.<br /><br />If you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's . If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's are head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was/is the biggest factor in my preference. With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts I was serving were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.<br /><br />***Note, I have pretty much the exact same review for the 1 lb. white, 1 lb. blue and 1 lb. yellow Mercken's Coatings, thanks to \"Cut and Paste\", to spare myself the trouble of re-writing the same review. Therefore, there is need to read my reviews for those items.\n",

It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed. But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.<br /> Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of \"baggies\" for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.<br /> We discovered that this tea, given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely. The main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves.\n",

      "I must say for the price of the coffee I was a bit nervous about what I might receive, but all I can say is that I am very pleased.  I would compare the flavor to a Maragoya, but a little lighter. It is a light roast so the flavor makes for an exceptional pairing to a simple breakfast of a croissant or other light bread, the flavor is by no means intense but it is there.  As for the acidic nature of the coffee I would place it is on par with most coffee house light blends and a below a Italian roast.  Overall a good coffee and if you do not like it, the tins are nice enough to make a present of or as a donatation to the church for after service coffee.\n",

      "On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.\n",

Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem.

      "First off, I noticed a fair amount of sediment that was trapped in the leaves; it doesn't seem to affect the flavor, but is definitely off-putting as it found its way thorough my teapot's mesh filter. This is my only real complain; however, due to the extremely low price I'm willing to forgive this aesthetic issue. The flavor is great, and you can get two to three good infusions from a set of leaves; use warm (~165 F) water for the first infusion, and allow the temperature to rise by a few degrees each additional steeping. I'd recommend using an airtight container for storage though; the bag the tea ships in is good, but two pounds of tea will last most several months.\n",

      "Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!\n",

      "OG Organic Green Tea is very aromatic and if I still have a photo of the nutrient panel I will upload it for you here: lots more in this green tea than probably any other you've seen.  A few people I asked have said that this brand of green tea has a very calming effect, even with the infusion of 100% certified organic Ganoderma Lucidum.  Like the black, latte, mocha, and hot chocolate, this is VERY flavorful.<br />By the way, even though the packet (this is in tea bag form) reads to steep in one cup of hot water, many of us OG distributors know that one teabag makes 3 to 5 cups of water.  Perfect for a small pot to share with guests.  I would not doubt it if someone loses more weight with this brand because of the Ganoderma, than with all other green teas out there.  What I liked the most was the aroma: to me, I noticed a bit of a lemon scent, and a tiny hint of mint.  Feels like a cozy morning when I drink it.  But, as I said before, I'm a OG girl coffee lover all the way. :) research 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease'' and see for  yourself how this can help you or someone you love.\n",

      "We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel \"Lucy\" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.\n",

      "Always looking for hearty, British \"lorry lay-by\" tea.  Lived in Scotland for a year and always enjoyed the strong, warming flavor of a cuppa right from the giant stainless pots.  Tetley's British Blend comes close, but as the reviews suggest, Tips is tops.  Quite likely that it WAS the tea I was drinking.  Brewed according to the rules - warmed pot taken to the boiling water and steeped for 5 minutes - it is rich and flavorful (flavourful?) without being bitter or harsh.  The real deal and my British \"madeleine\" that brings back the gray sky, dreary weather; fogged windows; the smell of wet wool.\n",

      "I love this pasta! I discovered it when I went with friends to a local restaurant (upscale Italian). We were surprised to find a gluten free option, so we ordered a rigatoni dish to see what they found good enough to put on the menu. It was so good we asked the waiter to find out what brand was being used.<br /><br />My sister and niece have celiac disease, and I usually cook separately for them. However at a recent family dinner I decided to serve everyone this pasta under spaghetti sauce, and they all raved. Not a one knew this was anything but regular wheat pasta.<br /><br />I followed the cooking time directions, and the pasta turned out to be close to al dente, so I would suggest that other users of this product do the same. This will avoid the gooey mess that one reviewer noted.\n",

      "I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.\n",

      "I picked up two bags of these from the refrigerated section at Whole Foods. Based on the reviews I'd read, I wanted to minimize my losses if I discovered I hated them.<br /><br />Most people reported they weren't good with marinara sauce, so I decided to try them for the first time in a stir fry dish.<br /><br />The amount of pasta in the fluid-filled bag looked really small, but it claimed to contain two servings. I was prepared for the \"fishy\" smell when I cut the bag open, so it didn't gross me out. I kept reminding myself \"I like fish!\" and I was fine. I followed the directions to rinse and drain the noodles thoroughly, then there was a choice to make: you could either parboil them for a couple minutes or microwave them for one minute. The microwave method sounded quicker and easier, so I popped them in. After that, the directions said to \"dry\" the noodles. I didn't like the idea of spreading the noodles out on paper towels, so I used a method I read about on the internet--I pan fried them in a nonstick skillet until they were dry. While they were frying, I used the edge of the spatula to cut them into manageable-sized pieces.<br /><br />I added them to the stir fry just before pouring in the sauce, heated through, and hesitantly tasted the result. It was good! I mopped up a plateful and wished I could go back for seconds. There were plenty of noodles for two, if you're not ravenous. I found them very filling--which is all to the good if you're dieting, right?<br /><br />I can imagine adding these to a bowl of beef broth for a filling lunch and practically no damage to my daily calorie \"budget.\" I might even try them with regular pasta sauce, despite the poor reviews, since I think the pan frying may have improved their texture enough to sub them for real pasta. Then again, I occasionally sub spaghetti squash for pasta, so maybe my pasta standards are unusually low.<br /><br />Bottom line, I will definitely buy more of these!\n",

To prepare, I rinse well with hot water or drop in boiling water for a minute (best) the let dry. As for flavoring, I find these to work best in \"Soup\" applications with strong flavors. Like tofu, these will absorb whatever they are cooked in. My fave and easiest method is to simply sacrifice a $0.20 Run of the mill beef ramen, steal the flavor pack, and cook my noodles in the broth. I also add  Heinz reduced sugar ketchup to add body to the sauce and give it a lip smacking goodness. A bit frugal, but it is really good.

      "With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.\n",

      "In addition to being a quality pasta, these tiny letters are fun to play with on their own.  They take about 10 minutes of boiling to cook, which surprised me, because they are so tiny.  However, they have to absorb a lot of water because they just about double in every dimension when cooked.  The pasta tastes good, and appears to be well-made and carefully packaged.<br /><br />I don't like to give my 3-year-old canned alphabet soup, since it contains a ton of sodium, MSG, and soggy vegetables, and it turns out she prefers these.  To make a quick snack for her, I use:<br /><br />1 cup organic chicken broth (low sodium)<br /><br />1/4 cup alphabet pasta<br /><br />pinch of salt<br /><br />Combine in a small saucepan and heat on medium for 12-13 minutes, starting with cold broth.

The first two I ate were both mushy, and one was bitter. :(  I can tell by the yellowish color that these have all been through something. I'm guessing severe temperature changes, maybe frozen and then too hot. I eat them for the selenium, which I can only hope is still good after whatever these nuts went through. It is a crying shame for such large beautiful nuts to be neglected to the point of becoming yucky. Nuts really should be kept cool and are probably best bought from a place that is air-conditioned, or even better, a place that refrigerates them, a service that the Amazon warehouses are not yet offering. Hopefully not every bag will be like this. You may get lucky and have some tasty ones, but if I were me, I wouldn't order these.\n",

I know gluten based veggie meats can be kinda icky but I like the option. We eat vegan at home and we are flexitarians away from home. First can I tried were the breakfast sausage. These are the most edible option they offer. These actually taste good. Then I tried the chicken dinner and the steak dinner and the turkettes and I became disenfranchised with this company's products. The gluten comes out in a watery 'gravy' as they call it which is flavorless and really gross. They could add a thickener and some flavorings but they don't.  The grain meat/gluten product is tasteless and has a very basic texture and is not creative in anyway to conform to the schmeat they are trying to replicate for vegans.<br /><br />Stick with Loma Linda or Worthington, they have some awesome products like ground meat and hotdogs/links that are great for use in everyday cooking. If you are looking for cans of different types of schmeat that all turn out to be the same lumps of brown gluten with no flavor, try Cedar Lake products.\n",

      "When I got to try Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee I wasn't expecting much. Any \"flavored\" coffee I had ever tried had been overpowering. I'm a big coffee fan, and like flavors like hazelnut or french vanilla from time to time, but usually via creamer so I can control the strength. With Melitta's coffee, I was pleasantly surprised on two counts.<br /><br />First, the flavors were not overpowering - that's a refreshing change! In fact, the hazelnut and creme brulee worked surprisingly well together. It definitely had a unique and complex taste that was more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Second, the taste of the coffee was really quite nice. (This was less of a surprise as I've been pleased with Melitta's regular coffee products.) Once prepared the coffee was really very smooth, flavorful, and lacking in bitterness. I brewed it three different strengths before posting this review. At 'medium' strength (2 tablespoons per 10-12oz coffee mug) the coffee was very good, smooth and flavors well blended, and no bitterness at all. At a weaker strength (as my spouse would make it) the flavors still come through but as you would expect the coffee flavor is off. At recommended strength (2 tablespoons per hypothetical 6oz cup) the taste was also very good - the coffee taste excellent, the flavors slightly on the heavy side (especially the creme brulee) and just a hint of bitterness that one would expect with strong coffee. In an office environment where the strength depends on who brews the pot that day, tasting good at any strength is a definite plus.<br /><br />The only (minor) downside at all was the packaging. It was ridiculously hard to open the package. I appreciate the strong seal for the sake of freshness, but I also like to be able to open a coffee bag :)<br /><br />If you're a coffee purist who has never liked flavored coffees, this one will not change your mind. But if you do like flavored coffee and have shied away from prepackaged flavor coffee because the taste has been overpowering, you should definitely consider trying Melitta's flavored coffee.\n",

      "****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****\n",

I have had to bring her to the vet every three months to have her glands emptied because the vet thought that might be part of her constipation problem. Since trying this food, she has had no problems!  I don't remember the last time she hacked up a hairball, and it has been months since she has been constipated.  This food is a little expensive, but well worth it.  Her poopie doesn't smell horrible, either, like it did on some of the other foods.  I will continue to buy this despite the price.\n",

It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.

      "I have been eating oatmeal on and off for the last ten years and recently I have found myself enjoying a nice hot bowl for breakfast, especially because its winter. I was first introduced to John McCann's Oatmeal when I decided to quit eating rolled oats because of their texture and the inspiration of watching the episode of \"GOOD EATS\" featuring steel cut or pinhead or Irish oats. I originally found these oats at my local market and found them to be delicious, although, they do take awhile to properly cook they are by far the best option in terms of flavor, nutrition and texture. Their flavor is similar to brown rice while still having a bit of a \"wheaty\" taste. They are very nutritious, but as most nutritious foods are, they must be portioned because of their high calorie content, (I find that half a cup, 300 calories, is the perfect amount) although they are very good for fighting cholesterol and the fat they contain is \"good\" fat. Their texture is also similar to brown rice, but softer and creamier if prepared in such a fashion. I make my oats two ways, on the weekdays I make them in a rice cooker overnight which produces a piping hot bowl of deliciousness and on the weekends I take my time and prepare them on the stove top. They really are a delicious way to start my day and I look forward to enjoying a bowl every morning. Being that I eat pinhead oats everyday I found that buying these tins was beginning to get quite expensive, so one day I went to a bulk foods market and bought a pound of bulk steel cut oats thinking they would be a lower quality and good for the weekdays. Since then I have done numerous side-by-side comparisons of the two and they are exactly the same in taste and texture, making paying double for John McCann's Oats a delicious, but obsolete choice nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious, nutritious, and the tin is re usable.<br />Cons: Somewhat expensive when compared to bulk options.<br />Overall: Buy these if you aren't going to be eating them everyday; they are delicious and well worth the money.<br /><br />I cook my steel cut oats on the stove top thusly:<br />1/2 cup steel cut oats<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 cup water (boiling)<br />1/2 cup milk<br />1 pinch of kosher salt<br />2 tsp sweetener (brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup)<br /><br />Take a 12\" sauce pan (or something comparable) with a lid and turn heat to medium, add butter, let melt and add oats. The idea here is to roast the oats. Be sure to shake the pan around every minute or so to keep the oats from burning. After about three to four minutes or until the oats smell toasty add the boiling water and drop the heat to low and cover. Let sit for thirty minutes and slowly stir the oats every five minutes until done. After thirty minutes has elapsed add milk, salt and sweetener stir until combined (If a more creamy mixture is desired add more milk or cream to oats). Serve hot and enjoy.\n",

      "Trident White makes a terrific \"cool rush\" flavored sugarless gum. The sugar free gum is healthier for your teeth; and the gum makes your breath fresh in an instant. The thin cardboard package is easy to carry because it is so small; and inside the thin cardboard package the pieces of gum are wrapped individually in tiny plastic pockets that are easy to open. The package states that the gum whitens teeth but I cannot comment on that. Always remember to brush your teeth--this gum isn't a substitute for that!<br /><br />A single piece of gum has absolutely no sugar; it has only a measly five calories--hooray! Trident White uses sorbitol and aspartame to sweeten the gum. There is no fat in this gum either.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some people won't be able to chew this gum because of certain ingredients that may disagree with them. This gum contains a milk derived ingredient; and it also contains phenylalanine. In addition, use this gum before any expiration date printed on the back of the thin cardboard container. Don't chew stale gum!<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem--the manufacturers give you both a toll free number and a website. The website goes into detail about how this gum helps to whiten your teeth.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great gum that comes packaged in an easy to carry container. This gum makes your breath fresh; and it's a very tasty gum that you won't want to spit out after a mere five minutes. The twelve-pack is economical, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\n",

It also has nearly no odor.

The flavored yogurt makes it interesting, and the Fiber One provides a granola-like crunch. Rather than look to the cereal itself for flavor and get less fiber with brands that offer maybe 10-15g per cup, you instead go for texture with the fiber and flavor with the yogurt and get much higher daily fiber. I'll probably be doing this daily combo for the rest of my life. My dad has hundreds of diverticuli and is 75yrs old, and has had zero issues with diverticulitis owing directly to his high fiber diet. The doctor cringes every time he looks at his colonoscopy.\n",

I got really annoyed by all the packaging, so I was extremely happy when I saw this 100-count box.<br /><br />That's ALL you get: one small box filled with 100 individually wrapped tea bags.

Also, no more fighting with the plastic wrap and filling your recycling bin with hundreds of flimsy little Stash boxes.<br /><br />The tea itself is delicious. Very earthy, clean and slightly grassy.

      "I have to agree with Dr. Pete's review below.  Up until this batch, Emeril's Big Easy was by far my favorite coffee.  To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.  I am really puzzled why more people have not experienced this; maybe my taste buds are growing Old? ;o)  However, my other coffees still taste the same.\n",

      "I swear a box of these lasted for three days between my boyfriend and me.  It's a very tasty snack and I don't normally like caramel popcorn.  For the price, I would prefer the popcorn just in a large bag inside so I could put whatever amount I wanted in sandwich bag.  I find all this \"convenience\" packaging a bit hard for my green side to take.  I don't think I would buy this item due to its price, even when it is on sale at my local grocery.  They had them two boxes for $5 which comes out to 50 cents a bag.  If I bought a bag of popcorn or even popped it at home, I could make a bag of it to take on trips for a fraction of the cost.  Overall, the box did disappear in my household rather fast, so if you don't mind extra packaging and want to pay a bit more for the convenience, then this is probably a product for you if you like popcorn as much as I do.\n",

      "Pho is one of my favorite comfort foods. I make my own pho broth by gallons using a great recipe and freeze it so I can make pho when I feel yucky. I was excited when I found this in the Supermarket, particularly when I saw no MSG in the ingredients. I do use their other broths quite a lot so I am familiar with their products and am usually satisfied.<br /><br />Part of the reason I make my own is to avoid MSG and other items but lack of MSG aside this stuff is terrible. It's bland and by shortcutting by using spice extracts and lime oil it just doesn't taste good. Plus by having lemon juice and lime oil in up-front it ends up with that 'cooked citrus' taste by the time its heated for use. This product would be improved by leaps and bounds just by eliminating the lemon juice and lime oil - lime is added at serving anyway. The broth also needs to be infused with the roasted spices, not just tweaked with extracts, IMHO. Plus by eliminating sea salt and using small amounts of good quality fish sauce there would be a far more rounded and balanced flavor. All in all I think if I need a quick pho fix I will need to look elsewhere. Pity.\n",

      "I haven't even tried this stuff yet, but with the first ingredient being salt, the second being MSG, then finally the third being dried bonito powder, then the next sugar, then dextrose(more sugar)...then some chemicals(disodium inosinate, disodium succinate), which sound like more salt or preservatives, or both...WTF? None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called \"monosodium glutamate,\" had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and \"monosodium glutamate\" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and \"monosodium glutamate\" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient \"monosodium glutamate\" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When \"monosodium glutamate\" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and \"monosodium glutamate\" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to \"monosodium glutamate\" did not appear until \"monosodium glutamate\" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to \"monosodium glutamate\" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an \"industry arranged whitewash\" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers \"voluntarily\" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in \"low fat\" and \"no fat\" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using \"monosodium glutamate.\" In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a \"clean label\" ingredient.\n",

      "I have a French Bulldog that has developed food allergies and is also a very picky eater. In our quest to find him a food that was good for him and he actually liked eating I stumbled on Taste of the Wild at a local specialty dog food store. I decided to give TotW a chance after trying Canidae and realizing that the protein content was too high for my Frenchie.<br /><br />After switching to Taste of the Wild I immediately noticed an improvement in my pups stool - nice and firm and only 2-3 movements per day. Vice 5+ movements on Nutro and Canidae. My Frenchie's notorious gas was also cut way down. I supplement his dog food with all-natural unflavored yogurt too and this helps cut down on the gas greatly. After a few weeks I also noted that my dog's coat is soft and shines.<br /><br />Another positive to Taste of the Wild is that their formulas are similar enough between Hi Prairie, Pacific Stream and Wetlands Canine that I can rotate the menu a bit and keep my pup happily chomping down on his food. Previously my dog would tire of the same dog food after only a few weeks.<br /><br />For anyone with a dog with food allergies I highly recommend Taste of the Wild. Not only are their formulas grain free, but they also use unique sources of protein. For example duck instead of the more readily available chicken as a major protein source.\n",

      "This is one of those soups that is perfect for a cold, winter day.  It is very hearty and filling, and splitting one can between a couple of light-eaters makes it perfect.<br /><br />This is a very creamy soup, very thick.  There are plenty of big and small chunks of potato.  The flavor of garlic really stands out, it is very tasty.  You WILL have some serious garlic breath afterward!  This soup tastes pretty salty, that's my only complaint.  As I worked my way through, the salt got a little more intense than I like.<br /><br />The ingredients are good, no artificial items to make you wonder what you're eating.  The sea salt is better than table salt, though it is still a high sodium food.  There is also quite a bit of fat (including saturated), so it shouldn't be something eaten regularly if you're watching fat intakes.<br /><br />All in all, Creamy Potato with Roasted Garlic is a very tasty and hearty soup that quickly fills you up and gives you a real kick with that garlic.\n",

      "The product seems to work well. My hair held it's shape most of the day. The only problem is the nozzle on the bottle. It's very difficult to use. It seems to require a lot of force to get the product out of the bottle. That's the only issue I really have with this product. Although it's volumizing mousse it still works well with curling irons. I have used volumizing mousse for this in the past. I have fine hair so it's enough for me. I'm not sure how much it protects from the heat but according to the bottle you really have to use a lot of product to get enough protection. You basically have to coat all your hair with the product. I will update again on the product later on when I've used it more. So far I have only used it once. I would likely not buy this again just cause of the nozzle. It's really difficult to use because of the force it takes to use it.<br /><br />Update 4/13/2011<br /><br />I was showing someone how it takes a lot of force to get the mousse to come out and when they tried it I heard a snapping sound and suddenly the mousse was coming out easily. It seems there may be something inside the bottle that has to be released in order for the mousse to come out like normal. I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. It seems I could not use enough force to snap the release but a male friend was able to. I used the mousse with my hot tools deep waver and the waves lasted for 2 and a half days and even withstood me sleeping in them. It probably would have lasted longer but at that point I wanted to wash my hair. If you use a lot of mousse the hair will become stiffer but better protection from the heat and the style lasts longer. I would purchase this again now that I realize what the problem was.\n",

      "I like this tomato soup a lot. It's smooth and has a sweetness to it that is very pleasant. I can't say it tastes or looks very much like tomato soup I've had before, but it's still very good. The color is more orange than you might expect, making it look like carrot soup. The third ingredient is evaporated cane juice, which is unusual.<br /><br />Hot or cold, this soup tastes good. The carton is made of paper (environment-friendly) and has a resealable lid. The rectangular shape is easy to store in the fridge, although the spout isn't the best design for pouring. Some of the soup dribbled down the side after I finished pouring a serving into my bowl. Sodium content is a bit high, at 26% of your recommended daily intake per serving. They are counting 2/3 cup as a serving, which is not realistic for a hungry person. There are 6 servings in here. 1 serving is 70 calories (20 from fat).<br /><br />The only ingredient I didn't recognize is disodium inosinate. Everything else is natural, like tomato paste, salt, water, garlic powder, corn starch. Much better than Campbell's Tomato Soup. Definitely give it a try. Made in NJ.\n",

I originally got it so that he could have something to do while I was gone and he was in his crate, and was very disappointed to find that he pulled the circular rawhides off in a matter of minutes...at first I thought, \"well there goes 10 bucks down the drain!\". But after that, it became his FAVORITE bone. He just loves throwing it around and chewing on the bone ends. It lasted about 6 months before he chewed both ends off (note: he is a very very intense chewer), and even after that, he still loves playing with the purple ball that came in the middle. I bought him a new bone for christmas and again, he can't get enough of it. My roommates dog has the same feelings for these bones, and we have affectionately started calling them their \"crack\" bones because we don't know why they are completely obsessed with them! I would highly highly recommend!!!\n",

I wanted to start with just a 4-oz. tin of loose tea, but that size was sold out, so I sprang for the full pound bag. Note to self: Don't EVER do that again!<br /><br />Why do I hate this tea so much? Call me crazy or stodgy or whatever you like, but I believe that flavored tea should first and foremost taste like tea. You should know that you're drinking tea that has flavor added. This tea is completely overwhelmed by the hot cinnamon. It tastes exactly like drinking an Atomic Fireball. Exactly. I like Atomic Fireballs, but I don't want a tea that tastes like one.<br /><br />I've tried adding just a pinch of this Hot Cinnamon tea to unflavored tea, trying to find the right balance of cinnamon flavor to tea taste. I haven't found it yet. The hot cinnamon dominates everything that I've tried it with.<br /><br />I know that this blend appeals to a lot of people. Just look at the reviews. I'm not one of them.

      "Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them \"raw\" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.\n",

These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of \"healthy\" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!\n",

If you're searching for the ultimate caramel sauce, this is it! It is thick, buttery-salty, and gets a little chewy when poured over ice cream. We had it slathered on dark chocolate ice cream one day; poured over French Vanilla ice cream the next day. It was so good, I bought a jar to take with me in my suitcase... only realizing afterwards that I couldn't take it in my carry-on luggage because it is considered a \"liquid.\" I was very bummed about that!

      "I had to report my opinion about these cookies even though I didn't order them on Amazon-- I bought them from the grocery store.<br />I left a box of the fig cookies with my Mom and was unable to try them, but she said they were really yummy and not super sickeningly sweet. Once I saw a chocolate creme cookie, I had to indulge.<br />And oh my goodness it was worth it.<br /><br />The cookie outside is a little stiff and crumbly, but that's to be expected with a gluten free cookie. I remedied the problem by microwaving the two cookies for 30 seconds (which turned them into warm delicious amazingness). They softened up quite a bit this way.<br />The flavor doesn't taste hazelnut-like to me, however, it isn't fudgey. The chocolate center is more of a ganache flavor and is really generous considering the calorie count - about 170 calories for 2 cookies is pretty good. These cookies taste more sinful than that.<br />I also want to mention the cookies come in a box with pre-packaged sets of 2. This is great for packing in lunches, taking on the go, or moderating your snacking ;)<br /><br />Overall, I really love these cookies. Not disappointed at all.. they are one of my favorite gluten free chocolate cookies available!\n",

If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again.\n",

      "I was very happy to find the Betty Crocker Gluten Free mixes at the local grocery store.  I've recently formed a gluten intolerance, but I do have a sweet tooth.  I have to be careful with soy protein, so many gluten free products are not usable for me as they use soy flour.  These however, do not.  The ingredients from the box are as follows:<br /><br />Rice Flour, Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin vanilla), Brown Sugar, Sugar, Potato Starch, Potato Flour, Leavening (baking soda, sodium acid pyrophosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Salt.<br /><br />I made the cookies per the directions on the box.  Due to the dryness of the mix once everything is together, I found it much easier to mix with my hands rather than with a whisk or a spoon.  Once that was done, I formed the dough in to 18 even sized portions, baked 6, and threw the rest in the freezer so I can pull out a cookie when I feel like having one.<br /><br />The flavor of these cookies is very good.  In fact, my two year old who does not like cookies gobbled these up.  I am giving it a 4 out of 5 though, because the texture is a bit grainy, which means the people in my house that have food texture issues thought they tasted nice, but had problems with the graininess.<br /><br />I think I will definitely buy again just so it is something to have on hand when in need of a sweet treat, especially if the frozen dough comes out nicely.\n",

I purchased some tonight at World Market and I must say that this is absolutely the worst tasting candy that I have ever come across. Believe me, I have done some serious traveling, everywhere from Canada, across the US, Mexico, South America, Jamaica, Britain, Belgium, the Philippines, Dominican Republic, Guam, and the Cayman islands. I have tried food and candies from each one of those locations, and I have never tasted anything like this candy. Please do not waste your money and buy this. The candy is so bad that most people I have given it to could not keep it in their mouth, but rather spit it out on the floor. I could not believe the taste when I tried it. Imagine if you will cramming an entire pack of filter-less menthol camel cigarettes in your mouth and smoking them, while at the same time chewing on a dirty tire and drinking water from a dirty ashtray... That may come close to the flavor of these little bad boys. These candies are made in Sweden therefore I have come to the conclusion that Swedish people have no taste buds.

Since it doesn't contain refined sugars, stimulants such as caffeine, or artificial sweeteners, it should appeal to my guests who are avoiding those ingredients.<br /><br />ETA: I've since tried the Sparkling Blackberry, and it is even more delicious, and a gorgeous rosy shade that looks beautiful in a glass of ice.\n",

      "I use the \"thinner\" ratio on the bottle and the resulting product is more like a crepe-pancake than a pancake.  And it's DELICIOUS.  Definitely my favorite way to have pancakes.  I use butter in the pan and don't find these to be bland at all.  In my opinion you don't need to add anything (like bananas or chocolate chips, etc) unless you want to, and you don't even need syrup.  The resulting pancake is a buttery slightly-salty wonder.<br /><br />I can imagine needing to add syrup, etc if you use the \"thicker\" ratio, because then the pancakes would be thicker, cakier, and more dry.  But if you make the thin version, you don't get bogged down in a thicky cakey middle.<br /><br />I love this.  I honestly think these pancakes are better than anything I'd make myself \"from scratch\" or that I've had in a restaurant, etc.  And that's not surprising.  Bisquick's whole business is essentially pancakes.  You'd think they'd get it right.  And they have!  Nothing to be ashamed of to really love their mix.  Just because they're commercial doesn't mean it's not a great pancake.<br /><br />(again, try the thinner version!)\n",

      "I have a 2 week old baby that LOVES to nurse.  He loves to suck I think partly for the comfort of it at times.  I have had an amazing milk flow production so far... however, a few days ago, I felt like I was running low, and I found myself drinking a chamomile vanilla tea about 3 times a day.  I LOVE herbal teas... so I thought, why not drink tea that will actually help with producing more milk.  I have been eyeing this on amazon lately.  I read a lot of reviews about taste, etc.  So I wanted to try it first.  I send my husband to our local organic health food store.  MIND you, he paid about  $8 for ONE box of 16 bags of tea.  I immediately tried some, and I take my tea with honey... and I REALLY liked it.  I was thinking to myself, why others do not like the taste?!  Another thing worth mentioning, I use my Keurig coffee maker to brew the HOT water, in my 16oz Contigo cup. I dont like the idea of a hot cup of tea around my baby without a lid and am paranoid it would burn someone.  I carry my Contigo cup everywhere with me, full of tea.  That said, I only use 1 tea bag in my 16onz cup.  This is double the size they say to use on the box. However, I dont think it is bad... You should drink significantly MORE water when you're nursing.  I actually always have my 30onz cup of ice water.  I do drink this tea before bed, typically 1 to 2 16onz cups.  I drink the same sized cup in the morning when I wake up, and throughout the day I drink it either over ice, or in the hot cup... As I said, I like the taste, and being that I am not going on 3 days drinking this, I can see the difference. If the difference is because of this tea, or just the fact that my son nurses A LOT and my body is making more milk to compensate for that fact, I dont care.  I like the tea and will continue to drink it.  THIS price here is the BEST I have found around.  I subscribed and saved too.<br /><br />I suggest watering down the tea a little if you think it tastes too strong and put some honey in it.  Honey is better than sugar and tastes delicious inside...\n",

Upon my first bite of these squared delights I fell in love with the flavor and texture. The dark chocolate is high quality but does overtake the flavor of the coconut which is firm and full of true coconut flavor. If you love Mounds bars or are a true lover of anything coconut then these squares of paradise are for you. Also the price of these boxes is actually cheaper than ordering directly from the manufacturer and you cannot beat Amazon's free shipping which makes this a product I would order again maybe in the key lime or pina colada flavors in the future.

There are a lot of other ways to get more fiber with fewer calories.

      "I love this stuff.  Normally I would eat egg whites and oatmeal, like my personal trainer wants me too, but I have a young kid (7) that I have to get ready for school each day, and I never seem to have time for cooking in the mornings.  My personal trainer actually put me on to Muscle Milk N' Oats when I decided to to a 2 week road trip and I knew I would have very limited chances to cook.  Since then I have been using them every time I need a good breakfast in a hurry (when I don't have time to make egg whites and oatmeal).  This stuff tastes great, and you can make it in about 2 minutes or less.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I love the Maple and Brown sugar flavor.  I tried the Vanilla flavor and I didn't like it.  I haven't tried the other flavors.  I have been eating the Maple and Brown sugar flavor almost every day for about 5 months and I haven't got tired of it.\n",

      "I literally just made my first loaf of gluten free bread mix with this product and I am truly amazed how good it is! It reminds me of the bread my Mom used to make, fresh out of the oven with all the good smells. I put butter and honey on the first slice and went right back to my childhood. Thank you Gluten Free Pantry!I have to say I have a plain Jane, single paddle breadmaker, nothing fancy so I was skeptical that my breadmaker would produce the best bread. I used the \"Rapid\" option and it came out just fine. The color and texture were perfect, it did not fall apart or have a strange flavor (as other bread reviews I read) and it could be sliced immediately (serrated knives work best). I will definitely buy more of this bread mix. I would like to recommend that they package this product for 1 1/2 lb loafs as well (my breadmaker only goes to 1 1/2 lbs) or in bulk bags for more economy.\n",

I found this place through Amazon and took a chance at getting a pound of beans. They arrived quickly and are absolutely beautiful! I may have underestimated how many vanilla beans are in a \"pound,\" as this is more than I need for now. So I've repackaged and sealed them to save for later. (You can separate them into smaller amounts and double-bag them in those Ziploc vacuum bags. They'll last forever. Even when they are no longer at their peak, you can still use them for flavoring.) I'm very happy with the purchase and the quality of the beans and will probably only buy from this place from now on. Good job, Vanilla Products USA!\n",

Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

      "My older cat, 4 years, got \"hooked\" on Hill's Science Diet Kitten formula when I brought a new kitten, along with a big bag of free S/D, home from the pound. [Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the \"good stuff\"]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one.\n",

Clif has released something tasty that I can eat without being the equivalent of a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NT69XU\">Snickers Bar</a>. It makes a great late night and on the go snack. While it's strawberry flavored (Yes, The review is based on the strawberry flavor), it doesn't taste a thing like strawberries. It tastes as artificial <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OIT8T2\">Skittles</a> but it isn't artificial and that's a beautiful thing. And While non-strawberry tasting strawberry flavor (At least I didn't think it tasted like strawberry) may be a minus for some people, for me, a person who doesn't like the taste of real strawberry, that's a plus. The shape of the rope is just like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4\">Red Vines</a> and if you've had the strawberry red vines, the taste isn't that much different. And for kids, if you remove the individual wrappers and place them in a Ziploc Bag, I doubt a child would be able to tell the difference to this and a piece of licorice. I placed a few in an empty <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UHADL4\">Red Vines</a> bag, my 9 year old nephew got into them, didn't know the difference.<br /><br />PROS<br />1. Great for kids lunches or a late night snack<br />2. 70 calories<br />3. No Extra sugar and/or High Fructose corn syrup or artificial sweetner<br />4. Organic And All Natural<br />5. 100 percent fruit with great taste<br /><br />CONS<br />1. Not so big on the strawberry flavor.<br /><br />To sum it all up, If you're looking for a nutritious snack for your kids, This is perfect\n",

I was excited to see it available on Amazon and ordered it so I could share it with my kids. At that time, the description and ingredients list on Amazon did not include peanut butter. One of my kids is severely allergic, we would not have bought it. I wrote a comment about that and now see that my comment is missing, and the ingredient list now says \"peanut butter.\" Good move Sweet Gourmet! Sadly my younger daughter could not try the taffy, but my older daughter brought it to school to share with her class as part of her NJ state report. Unfortunately when we opened it many pieces of taffy had melted out of their wrappers and were stuck together. Uncomfortable situation but we made the best of it. So...the product is fantastic.

The great ones have endured, and everybody knows where to go for great Italian food.  But, when everybody is making the same stuff really well, what you're left with is your personal preference.  Weaver's is lucky to have some devoted coffee drinkers, but they're not a new standard by any stretch of the imagination, way too many people growing & roasting great coffee for that.\n",

Most of the time I don't even notice them. It's the seeds themselves that lock in their sugar and water until you ingest them, and then slowly release them for sustained endurance and hydration. They are loaded with fiber, calcium, protein, magnesium, and more.

      "I found these grahams to be very good.  I think the thing I like most about them is the crisp texture.  If you have eaten a Nabisco honey graham cracker lately you will probably remember that while they may seem somewhat crisp when you first open a packet of them, they soon absorb every water vapor molecule in the room and get sort of soft.  Anyway, the \"Back to Nature\" grahams don't do this!  They are crisp, and have a good flavor.  I rate them higher than Nabisco's.<br /><br />Here's what my wife had to say about them...<br /><br />You know me- you just can't stop me from being ultra helpful.  In that vein, I decided to open up your Vine grahams box and give them a whirl.  LOVE them.  LOVE everything about them.  One a scale from 1-5 stars, they are a 6.  I am sure the price isn't cheap, but if money wasn't an issue, I would buy them exclusively and eat them daily.  They are better than Oreos and even healthy.  In fact, you feel like you are doing something virtuous for your tongue and you abs.  Super crunchy and loaded with flavor.  I am going to hide them from the kids and splurge myself- the kids can eat the Goldfish.  Love the enviro-freindly packaging too (minimum of 55% recycled cardboard), as well as their support of The Nature Conservancy.  Whole grains (wheat and oats) at their finest.<br /><br />So, all in all, as far as graham crackers go, these are top notch.  They don't taste like health food while being healthy, and at the same time allowing us to contribute to a good cause!<br /><br />5 stars!\n",

      "My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.\n",

With other teas, sometimes I like to put in two tea bags so that the flavor is more potent.  I don't advise doing that with this tea.  It has a subtle almost bitter flavor that's nice when you use one.  With two, it feels far too strong.<br /><br />I typically don't buy black tea like this.  I usually buy flavored black tea (artificial or natural).  I always fear plain black tea will taste bland like Lipton.  I tried another UK tea and it did taste like Lipton.

      "Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) \"price is no object\" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK\">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for \"hill's science diet dry dog food.\"  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6\">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.\n",

      "Purchased this for my 3 year old Dalmatian who suffers from separation anxiety and boredom when my husband and I leave for work.  We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time.\n",

The price is very economical.<br /><br />I recommend a smaller pack first, to make sure you like it.  Then if you do,  you can buy this bulk pack.\n",

      "I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this \"Lickety Stik\" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.\n",

      "As for the Green Mountain K-cup.  These k-cups do not give you the flavor you would normally get from brewing Green Mountain coffee.  The k-cups are week and taste watered down compared to brewing the loose/ground coffee in a conventional way, thus my 3 star rating.  With that said:  These k-cups are slightly better than other k-cups on the market.  If you are going to use k-cups I would recommend this brand and brew.  I would also recommend buying at Amazon as the prices are right compared to other sites.<br /><br />This k-cup is over priced.  If you look at the price you pay for this k-cup compared to the loose ground/whole beans you would be surprised.  You pay $0.50 a cup for a k-cup and $0.05 a cup for loose.  You get a 100 x's better cup from loose then with a k-cup.  Why pay more for a crappy cup?  Convenience!  But there are ways to avoid that cost<br /><br />The environment.  By using the loose/ground and the k-filter you help save the environment as all you toss out is ground coffee.  Every k-cup used takes up space in a landfill somewhere.  In my opinion it is the same as using a foam cup as to a ceramic mug to drink your coffee.<br /><br />Keurig.  This machine is convenient and quick.  But it is expensive to use with the k-cups, costing the average family $50+ a month.  To cut this cost to as low as $10 I use the k-filter with the machine and Green Mountain is one of my brands.  The loose/ground coffee in the filter gives you a stronger cup but still not the greatest but better than the k-cup alone by far.  Using the Keurig you must make a choice to sacrifice quality over conveinance.  I make that sacrifice during the week as I have little time on the weekday's to brew a pot of coffee. But I choose to use the filter with the Green Mountain loose/ground coffee and get a slightly better cup and save about $40.00 a month.\n",

      "On a cost-per-ounce basis, this product is far closer to fancy imported spring waters from tropical islands than it is to any of the other purified tap waters available in their single-use plastic bottles.<br /><br />And that's all it is: purified tap water, with baking soda and a few other things added.<br /><br />Is the pH really 9.5? Who knows. Most of us aren't going to spend the money to buy the equipment to test it. (And that's not even getting into the company's interesting claim that the water is 'too pure' to test with cheap litmus paper. If the water were pure, the pH would be 7. All the fun chemicals they add to change the pH necessarily make it no longer pure.)<br /><br />What i can say is, whatever the pH was, it made no impression on a mild case of heartburn, the kind that can be knocked out with one or two chewable antacid tablets. I didn't feel more hydrated after 1.5 liters of this than i'd feel after 1.5 liters of any other water.<br /><br />The taste? Water. I drink a lot of water, mostly straight tap water, sometimes filtered with a standard filter pitcher, and every once in a while from a pre-packaged bottle of water when i plan badly and my reusable bottle runs dry. Essentia wasn't noticeably different.<br /><br />There are a lot of websites out there that promise all sorts of health benefits for drinking high pH water. There are even some people with an MD after their name that back up the claims. But that's the great thing about the internet: there's a website for everything, and often someone with a fancy degree swearing it's all true.<br /><br />So if you want to pay a pile of money for water that is, at its core, tap water with some stuff filtered out and other stuff added in, that's your business. But if you believe all the marketing hype, well, i've got a bridge for sale...\n",

Not too sweet, definitely not too unsweet, it's JUST right!  You Oreo types should stay away, you won't like them. For the more discerning cookie lover.  They're addictive, before you know it, 4-5 are gobbled up.  They're very fragile, though.  Quite a few of my packages had broken cookies in them, as if they had been tossed roughly during transport.

However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation.

      "This marinara sauce is not just dinner - it is an experience!<br />I've tried so many sauces over the years and had almost given up finding a store-bought variety that would be worthwhile. Then I found this one at our local Kroger store. This sauce is so indescribably good that it actually, literally brought goose bumps up and down both of my arms. The other brands of sauce are monstrosities of monumental proportions compared to Rao's. I would never have thought that any mere mortal could combine a few simple ingredients in the perfect proportions and come up with something like this marinara that defies description. My God, it was like it made love to my whole mouth! It permeates the tongue and palate, even teeth and gums and the insides of my whole mouth - making this sauce \"the flavor to savor,\" even an hour after dinner. I've never tasted any other pasta sauce that even approaches this sublime sauce. It is so rich and flavorful. Try this sauce and you will understand why I'm gushing and drooling all over for this heavenly marinara. I gladly paid the $10 this evening for another jar, this time for the arribbiata which is also delicious. I never would have thought any pasta sauce could taste this good, fantastic actually. It is even better than my mother's and my uncle's. You will think that you died and entered the Pearly Gates, dripping with Rao's Marinara!\n",

      "I puchased this tea after some research, and recommendation from a friend.  Obviously, my concern was not producing enough milk for baby, so I decided to give it a try.  I must say that I am not a tea drinker.  This is the first tea I have ever had, and it doesn't taste good or bad.  I found it be pretty bland, and after drinking it for a while, it doesn't taste better or worse.  Per the instructions on the box, it says to drink 3-5 teas/day.  I drank 3/day for about a day and half before I noticed the increase in milk production.  It was not drastic, but enough for me to pump and freeze for when I returned to work.  I went from barely pumping 3 ounces to pumping 4-5, every 3 hours.  The tea works, but you must also stay hydrated, eat well, and rest as much as possible (if possible with an infant).  I have been drinking this tea for almost 3 months now, and I feel like it definitely works for me.  If you're hesitant, just know you have nothing to lose by trying :)\n",

      "Let me qualify myself.  Been brewing espresso for about ten years.  Last five years using fairly high end equipment and superior beans ground for each cup.  Nearly all the time I make my espresso straight with a quarter tea spoon sugar and no milk.  Therefore my espresso reflects the flavor of the type of bean with a light softening of the bitterness by sugar.<br /><br />  All this experience indicates beans taste best immediately after roasting and/or opening a vacuum bag.  Taste and crema amount tapor off in the first week quite a bit.  Personal tastes may come to other conclusions but freshness makes a big difference.<br /><br />  Bought two fifty pod bags of espresso.  Among those the Lucaffe' Classic was better than most of the twenty five varieties (four each) I tasted.  Your taste might be different.  This Lucaffe' Classic is smoother, less bitter, and hints at some pleasant subtle flavors I found unique.<br /><br />  Perhaps more important than this particular pod expresso is the clear conclusion for me that pods produce much better espresso flavors than all my efforts to brew from freshly ground beans.  Clean up to a lot easier and each shot consistantly fresh due to the foil containers.  It is possible over time even the foil wrapping will not prevent loss of flavor I do not know.  There is no date on wrapped pods.<br /><br />  Bottom line:  Pod espresso is superior to grinding your own.  Freshness is more consistant.  Clean up is a LOT easier. Time from start to finish is much less.  Now I grind only for regular coffee.<br /><br />  IMPORTANT for POD brewing with my machine is plenty of warm up time for espresso machine which reduces amount of extraction in normal brew time of TWENTY TWO SECONDS plus or minus a few seconds.  Too short warm up can double ounces extracted in given time.  And it is possible that some brands of pods allow too much liquid to pass in twenty two seconds which is the standard time generally accepted.<br /><br />  Have you noticed these pods are the same concept as the Nespresso machines and other similar types?  However these pods offer more variety and more competition among suppliers can lead to lower prices if you buy the 150 pods size.<br /><br />  So why only four stars?  Some other pods taste slightly better to me.  I would give my own, from scratch, brews only three stars compared to pods who get four or five stars.\n",

      "Upon sniffing this treat, I've had dogs compulsively sit before me, wide-eyed and hopeful.  Even torn into impossibly tiny shreds (easily done with its maleable yet resilient texture), these morsels are gobbled up.  I had a dog actually excited over getting to eat the few crumbs left in my treat pouch which I fished out after the treats were gone.  I can't imagine the glee an entire one of these gigantic treats would induce.  So far, I've fed these in strips.  They're large; a palm-sized flat piece of jerky.  It has a softer texture than jerky; it's maleable, not easily crumbling or mushing together in a treat pouch, yet torn apart effortlessly by a human or canine.  They're perfectly chewy yet not moist, so they don't dirty your hands or surfaces.  They smell *FABULOUS*.  They're like a nicely seasoned steak.<br /><br />I use these for scenting/tracking (wonderfully effective and motivating), high-focus training, breaking bad habits and filling puzzle toys.  They're a little more expensive, but they last a lot longer if you remember to feed like a filet mignon, not like a Milkbone.  Also, if you subscribe to \"treat value level\" theory, having a few of these on hand during training is a lot easier \"ace in the hole\" than messy hot dogs, cheese or freeze-dried liver.  They're a high-value treat that's easy to store & carry.<br /><br />Four paws up.  (yes, they're defying gravity for these treats!)\n",

      "I had previously tried the Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger and the Velveeta Zesty BBQ Chicken before with great results.  Unfortunately, our luck ran out with the Chicken and Broccoli dinner kit.  First, as many others have pointed out.  The broccoli is a freeze dried, powdery substance (but of course it would have to be, in order to keep in a box) and has the look of parsley flakes.  There was no discernable broccoli taste in the finished product. I'm not particulary fond of orzo pasta, but in this case I don't think another type of pasta would have changed anything with the taste, but perhaps the texture would have been a little better.  I used just a bit under 1 pound of chicken, and I don't think the seasoning packet contained enough, because the dish was quite bland.  However, there was plenty of the Velveeta cheese sauce, but, as much as my kids and husband love it, it was not enough to save this meal.  Also, the look of the meal was very bland and had no visual appeal. As I stated with my reviews of the other Velveeta Skillets, one box is not enough for the four members of my family who don't eat baby food.  With the other meals I prepared two boxes of the meal, but with this one I only prepared one, and used it more as a \"side\" dish to a large salad and breadsticks.  While I will continue to purchase the Ultimate Cheeseburger and Zesty BBQ meals, I will not be purchasing any more of the Chicken & Broccoli skillets.\n",

      "There have been some harsh reviews about the ingredients in the liquid Similac Sensitive.  It is true that milk based formula should be first choice as it is closest to mother's milk.  When milk can't be used due to a lactose intolerance, another form of carbohydrate is needed.  Corn maltodextrin is just an easily digested sugar.  It IS used as a \"filler\" in adult food.  This is not always a good thing because as adults  we don't need extra empty calories.  Babies DO need the calories and easily processed sugar are a gentile way to get them.  There is a history of (baby and adult) lactose intolerance on my husbands side.  After trying to reduce gas in many other ways, we switched and have seen a great reduction in gas amount and pains.  It has not been a cure, but with other gas management techniques, we are all happier.<br /><br />Pros: Already made for travel or middle of the night feedings.  Good for babies that are sensitive to lactose.<br />Cons: Some complain about the dark formula color stains.  Higher price than powder.\n",

      "One day an English pal of mine and I got into a discussion about tea vs. coffee.  Being a consummate coffee drinker I felt that no tea could ever satisfy me.  He was used to drinking instant coffee and therefore I felt that I must educate his palate.<br /><br />He sent me a package of Taylor's of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea and from that very first taste I was hooked. This tea is a blend of Assam and African tea and makes a deep, dark, rich, fragrant cup of tea.  Dark and strong enough to make me not crave my coffee over much!  While I will never give up my Sumatran coffee, this make an ideal substitute for when I'm getting an upset stomach from too much coffee.  It's so much less acidic.<br /><br />Plus I found out quite by accident just how economical this tea was.  While the English may not print directions for every little thing like us Americans do, I wasn't sure without directions just how long I was supposed to brew the tea or how big a mug I should brew it in.  We with trial and error I found that one tea bag will make a wonderfully strong 24 ounce mug of tea (yes I did measure it!) and I suspect that if I let it brew and steep a little longer one bag may get nearly a whole small pot (36 ounces)out of it!<br /><br />I'm hooked and it's all thanks to Yorkshire Tea and my pal Frank!\n",

      "I got my kittens from two different breeders both of whom were feeding RC Babycat and various other RC formulas for their sires and queens. I transitioned my kittens from Babycat to Kitten 36 very easily. Currently, they are close to one year old and I've gone ahead and begun the two way equal mix of RC Kitten 36 and RC Adult 27 for transitioning. So far, my experience with the 3 RC formulas have been excellent. I have an issue with the Adult formula kibble size but that's another review for another time.<br /><br />My kittens love the taste of Kitten 36. We free feed dry by choice and my kittens love to munch on this kibble! Price is outrageous, but I pay it. One of the large box pet stores (5 letters in the name) has a very good customer program. After I signed up and told the system what kind of cat food I buy, I began getting coupons for RC cat food. Up to $3 off a bag, buy 4 cans get 1 free, etc. I'm taking one star off for price.<br /><br />From my vet I learned RC caters to breeders with 'breed specific' formulas and just about every other targeted need from nuts to bolts. I don't know if breeders are getting kick backs or not. I'm embarrased to ask those breeders I know but really, I have no complaints. I believe RC spends alot of money on R&D and are truly interested in the health of our cats. Having said this, from my readings and poking around in the cat food world, there are other dry foods I might be interested in introducing. I plan on doing that using the new kibble as a treat rather than a meal.\n",

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their \"original\" flavor...I can't imagine what the \"Salt & Pepper\" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a \"healthy\" alternative to chips.\n",

      "Splenda is Splenda. That's easy. It works to create an illusion of sweetness. It can be most helpful if staying away from regular sugar is necessary. I was thin, too thin, for many years but gradually that changed. I still didn't have to count calories, just stay away from ingesting too much or too fatty food, but even that changed. Now I am analyzing my intake to eliminate the empty calories of cane sugar, corn syrup and the ilk, even the fructose of 100% fruit juices in favor of consuming the whole fruit.<br /><br />What's not easy is choosing whether to use an artificial sweetener. First of all, some people mistrust them, suspect them of being carcinogens etc. and ask whether the cure might be worse than the disease. Some of the other artificial sweeteners, which shall remain nameless, might bear investigation.<br /><br />But Splenda, which has only been available in the US for a dozen years, is sucralose plus dextrose and/or maltodextrin. Sucralose is actually derived from sugar but has no calories. The fillers add calories but not nearly as many as sugar. In addition, Splenda is heat-stable to 450F and does not add an artificial flavor to baked goods. However it is questionable whether the vitamins survive the heat of cooking.<br /><br />I find Splenda especially helpful in making desserts sugar-free when necessary, everything from puddings to pies to betties. This Splenda claims no calories, as do their other varieties. The actual caloric content of a single-serving, 1-gram packet [which is the size of the packet reviewed here] is 3.36 calories, which is less than a third of the calories of a single-serving, 2.8-gram packet of granulated sugar. FDA regulations allow foods to be labelled zero calories, \"if the food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving\". So that gets just a mite tricky. Regardless of FDA regs, I feel it is questionable to emblazon the packaging with a claim of \"No Calorie Sweetener\" when it actually does have them.<br /><br />Another packaging issue is the description \"Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)\". That made me think I would receive four packages of 0.7 oz. each which I could use in baking. But in fact there are 80 tiny foil packages suitable for use in individual cups of whatever, and the box states \"Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar.\" No problem; you just need to be aware of what you will be getting as this stuff is really expensive.\n",

      "A friend gave me a bar of this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NF4C7E\">Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate 100g</a>, imported from Poland by his girlfriend's family. I've had lots of amazing European chocolate so I opened it with high expectations.  Yes, it has an exceptionally creamy texture and very nice mild flavor, a bit sweeter than I expected and quite milky.<br /><br />Milka's not the chocolate for me, though. I prefer chocolate that's less sweet, darker and more strongly chocolate-flavored; 60 or 70% cocoa. Milka is probably not more than 30%. It's a nice product for those who like that concentration.<br /><br />Though this may be more information than you want in a review of a chocolate bar, I'd like to tell you about the company. Milka, first created in Austria over 100 years ago, is produced in several European countries and capitalizes on the idea of creamy milk from cows raised in the pure air of the Alps (though they don't mention where the cocoa comes from). Its wrapper is, and always has been, a distinctive lilac color with a purple and white cow pictured on it (explaining the Ogden Nash in my subject line).  Since 1970 the company has been through a couple of mergers and was acquired by Kraft Foods in 1990.<br /><br />I went to the company website to see if they sell darker chocolate. The home page asks you to choose a country--U.K., Turkey, Russia, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, etc. Each country's page is the distinctive Milka purple with an Alpine scene, and several have sound effects of lowing cows and chirping birds.  On the U.K. site you can follow an interactive tour and meet an Alpine cow (\"Make a Moooo Mate\") and there seems to be something similar on the other pages.  Each country's site has a link to other Kraft company sites.<br /><br />To sum up: very nice chocolate if it's the sort you like. I enjoyed it well enough but liked the website much, much more.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010\n",

      "I, just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning. I have been making Cajun Catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years. I have tried other seasonings when this one was not available, but it's just not the same. If you want to try my recipe, it's very easy. I melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously<br />coat the fish with the seasoning. Meanwhile I preheat a cast iron skillet. When the skillet is hot I put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side About 4-5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish. During this I make a pot of spaghetti, my wife likes angle hair, after the pasta is done, drain it and remove the fish to a platter, turn off the heat under the skillet, add a little more olive oil and butter, scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil, than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish. Everyone love it. To give this dish a little color, you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking, or stir in a small can of diced Cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet, or use both. Hope you enjoy it if you try it.\n",

      "In my personal opinion, this butter is an excellent way to put essential fat into your diet, deliciously!  The value of good quality fat and oil in the diet is not only underrated, it is touted as 'bad' for you...that it will make you fat.  But it is far from the truth...the body needs good quality fat for proper functioning! It is the hydrogenated and heat processed fats that the body doesnt know what to do with so it is stored as 'fat'.  The movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" had a profound effect on me regarding the healing power of natural oil, particularily in neurological conditions...and having a son with Asbergers (mild autism) again shows me how natural oil works in healing, though in his case it was with cold pressed Castor oil.  But less I digress further, let me just say this butter is wonderful!\n",

Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds\n",

I have been disappointed with pretty much every one I have tested.<br /><br />Instead of these Parampara mixes, try to find Shan mixes.  I am soooooo thankful to the Pakistani lady who turned me on to them.  They are perfect for recreating an authentic Indian/Pakistani meal.  Just like these Parampara mixes, all you do is add the meat and or vegetables, oil, etc. to the spice mix.  The complete directions are printed in english on the back of the box.  They have the perfect spice blend and heat.  I can only highly recommend the Shan: Chappli Kabab!  I grilled my patties out on the grill and served them with Naan, lettuce leaves, and a cool cucumber raita.  And Dal Curry for a side.  Mmmmm, totally yummy!\n",

I gave this 2 stars because of this problem from the seller but I don't know yet what to think of the coconut milk itself as I have not yet opened one of the four seemingly undented cans. Some posters here have said the cans are BPA free but the cans don't look high enough quality to be BPA free. Eden Foods use BPA free cans and their cans LOOK high quality.

      "I have a group of teas that I alternate between depending upon my mood. This tea fills a void I didn't realize exists in my favorites -- chocolate tea. This is a medium body tea -- not weak and not strong. It has absolutely no harsh bitter aftertaste and I brewed it at different time intervals, and no bitterness appeared. I followed the package recommendations to steep for 3-5 minutes, and ignored the boiling water directions and just used very hot water to steep the bag. At three minutes it was a bit too weak, but it seemed just right at five minutes. I left the bag in the cup and let the tea cool down to see if it would become too strong or lose its smoothness as it cooled -- it did neither. The results seemed to hold firm at the five minute mark. I often use tea in cooking but this tea would not work for that purpose -- it isn't strong enough to impart flavor as an ingredient in other dishes. The tea is organic and Kosher, and 1% of sales benefit social, environmental and sustainable causes.<br /><br />There is a lovely pronounced chocolate flavor in the background that oddly enough works perfectly with the black tea. There are much milder hints of cinnamon, orange and nutmeg that also help to create the tea's special blend. And, although the chocolate isn't strong enough to cause me to skip dessert, it might do in a pinch. I will definitely add this tea to my list of favorites -- it is that good. And, I would definitely curl up with a cup of Chocolate Puerh to sip and savor on a rainy day.\n",

Just a little hot..you can always make it hotter if you wish...but very flavorful, very tasty.<br /><br />But the bad..<br />First, this is not going to be a cheap meal. One box would cost about $7. Then you need the meat. 28 ozs. of beef tenderloin, as they suggest, at what, $15-20 a pound and you would be looking at $30-$40-$50 dollars. It is good, but not that good. I used maybe half that amount of beef, because that is what I had on hand and added a lot of veggies, but it still would not be cheap.<br /><br />Then, there is the nutritional values. The box contains almost 1700 calories. Add in meat and serve with rice..Of course they get around that, in their minds but listing the box as containing 15 serving! Really? Well, that would be one very, very small serving. Realistically it contains 4-5 serving. Calculate 20% of the 135g of fat, 20% of the 3450mg of salt..and that is without the fat to cook the meat and/or veggies in or the meat itself...and this is not a healthy dish.\n",

      "I've tried a number of \"nutrition bars\" over the years.  There are certain characteristics that make them acceptable and desirable:<br /><br />1.  Taste - they have to taste halfway decent.  I realize these bars in general aren't supposed to be candy bars, but in the heat of competition or need, a bit of taste isn't bad.<br /><br />2.  Calories - one of the reasons for having a bar is to supplement your diet.  For example, I ran 10 miles this morning, costing me about 1000 calories.  Most bars are in the 200-300 calorie range.<br /><br />3.  Fat - I'd like the calories from fat to be less than 30%.<br /><br />4.  Ingredients - when push comes to shove, organic, whole grains, and few additives is my goal.<br /><br />5.  Fiber - at least 6 grams of fiber per serving helps the world go round.<br /><br />6.  High fructose corn syrup - avoid, avoid, avoid.<br /><br />7.  Consistency - they shouldn't fall apart as you are eating them.<br /><br />So this particular bar, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar (Orange Cranberry) has a nice taste (and some orange peel and cranberries in the ingredients!), is 200 calories with 50 calories from fat, has 7 grams of fiber, is a bit crumbly (don't eat it on a treadmill), and is mostly whole wheat, corn, and oats (nice).  It's not vegan.<br /><br />In general, I liked it.  Better than some, but I'm not giving up my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RDRO\">Clif Bars</a>.  Clif bars are less crumbly and made of USDA organic ingredients.  However, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bars are not a bad option when Clif bars aren't around.\n",

      "I got this drink after my brother had one and said it was amazing. I believe his words were \"viagra in a cup\" lol. He said that it made his sex life amazing. I was curious to try one, but no stores will carry something with the word \"gasm\" in the tile. The day it arrived it just so happened I hadn't eaten at all since early that morning and it was about dinner time. I had one, which tasted great, a nice little buzz in the brain came on after a couple sips. I didn't notice anything after that so I immediately had another one. I didn't realize it takes a few minutes for these to take affect. I was seriously sceptical about these but a few minutes after after my second something happend. BAM, this stuff had a major affect on me. I have a high libito to begin with, but after taking two of these, OH MY GOSH! I've never had sex before or anything like it because I'm waiting to with my wife, so believe me when I tell you this stuff does not help when living an abstinence lifestyle lol. I had to go workout for 2.5 hours to work off the amount of \"energy\" this stuff gave me. This is not a placebo affect I assure you haha. For this to work best you have to take it on an empty stomach and it really does work. Hope this helped!\n",

      "I have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years.  It was the only canned chicken sold in North America that contained no food additives.  It was just chicken, water, and sea salt.<br /><br />As of this month( March 2011) new labelling and contents  have appeared.  The label now proclaims \"Better Flavor\".<br /><br />The product now contains 50% more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing \"reduced sodium\" vesions of their tradtional products.<br /><br />Worse yet, the \"Better Flavor\" is achieved by adding \"rice starch\", \"vegetable starch\" ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch) and \"chicken broth\" - which contains, among other listed ingredients, \"natural flavor\" (derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ).<br /><br />This product is now useless to me as I am highly sensitive to corn products.  While the label still claims the product is gluten free, which was pretty much guaranteed before, since it had only chicken water and sea salt in it, this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive, there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and \"flavors\"<br /><br />The company needs to re-think this change.  What made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets, was their plain and simple good food.  Now they are little differnt from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives.<br /><br />They can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn, processed starches, who are on the Atkins or no grain diets, who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes, and who avoid processed food additives in general.<br /><br />The company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say \"potato starch\" rather than \"vegetable starch\" AND in bold print say \"Contains Corn\" to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product.<br /><br />Hopefully this \"Better Flavor\" change will be about as successful as New Coke\" and we will see Valley Fresh \"Classic\" chicken in a year so.\n",

There are not enough salmon in there to entice the cat.<br /><br />2) Way too dry. I have to mix water in with the cat food, otherwise my cat won't even touch it.<br /><br />3) Results in extremely stinky excrement.

      "All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.\n",

      "Tea Antioxidants<br />----------------<br /><br />Antioxidants can help the body protect itself against free radicals--molecules that can damage cells. Antioxidants in tea called flavonoids can do that.<br /><br />Whether iced or hot, Teas made from real tea leaves provide more than great taste. Like fruits and vegetables, regular and decaffeinated brewed teas contain natural antioxidants called flavonoids* (10-22, 68, 69). Research suggests that antioxidants can be beneficial to health by helping the body protect itself from the harmful effects of \"free radicals\" (1-9, 26-30, 73-75). Free radicals, molecules which occur in the environment and are naturally produced by the body, can cause damage to cells. Chronic damage by free radicals is one factor thought to contribute to the development of many chronic diseases including heart disease or cancer. An average cup of brewed green or black tea has 150-200 mg of flavonoids (10-21).<br /><br />Currently, tea's potential health benefits are the focus of many scientific studies, and new research is emerging regularly. The American Dietetic Association in its Position Paper on Functional Foods included black and green tea as functional foods. Based on the available scientific research, the paper stated that the health benefits of drinking black or green tea include possible reduced risk for coronary heart disease, as well as gastric, esophageal and skin cancers (33). Tea and tea flavonoids have also been shown to help strengthen the body's immune system (34-43, 57-64), protect teeth by inhibiting plaque bacteria (44, 45, 56), potentially fight free radicals produced during strenuous exercise (76-80), and possibly increase calories burned during everyday activities (65, 66). While this emerging research is promising, more studies on the role of tea and tea antioxidants must be completed before drawing any conclusions about tea's contribution to health and wellness.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Heart Health Research<br />---------------------<br /><br />Heart disease is a major cause of preventable disease and death in all regions of the world. In America over 40% of all deaths are caused by heart disease which affects over 64 million men and women, almost one quarter of the US population (1). In light of such a high incidence of heart disease taking simple dietary steps to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease could have a significant impact on public health. As part of a healthy lifestyle regular tea drinking may help maintain a healthy heart.<br /><br />Current Research<br /><br />A number of population studies conducted around the world including studies in United States and Europe have consistently found that drinking black tea is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Three separate analyses of research showed that drinking three cups of tea daily reduced the risk for cardiovascular disease death or heart attack by about 10-12% (3, 4, 80).<br /><br />One of these analyses reviewed 17 population studies and assessed the effect of tea drinking on stroke, heart attack, and all types of coronary heart disease. Results showed that the rate of heart attack decreased by 11% among those who drank three cups of tea per day (3). A second analysis included seven studies and evaluated consumption of dietary flavonoids and risk of death from heart disease. Reported in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, investigators found a 20% reduction in risk of death from coronary heart disease among study participants who consumed the most dietary flavonoids (tea was the primary source of flavonoids) when compared to study participants who consumed the least dietary flavonoids(4). A third review of 10 studies showed that drinking around 3 cups of tea each day reduced the incidence of heart attack by 11% and reduced the rate of death from heart disease by 11% (80). Together, these studies show drinking tea regularly may help maintain a healthy heart as a part of a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />How can tea do that?<br /><br />Since heart disease is a complex disease with multiple risk factors there are several possible roles tea may play that might explain the reduced risk of disease observed in people consuming black tea. Clinical studies have shown that tea flavonoids may promote good heart health by improving endothelial function (44, 45, 46) and by reducing blood cholesterol levels (64, 66, 68, 79).<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Tea and Body Protection<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />A healthy immune system protects the body from infection and disease. A number of test tube studies have shown that some flavonoids help immune response by acting as anti-allergic (135, 136, 137), anti-inflammatory (138, 139), anti-viral (140) and anti-bacterial agents (80, 141, 142, 143). Furthermore, flavonoids have been shown to modulate the function of blood cells that are relevant for the immune response (81) and in both human and animal studies flavonoids have been shown to fight bacteria (80, 141, 142, 143) and thus improve resistance to infection. In addition, cell studies have shown that flavonoids in black and green tea have anti-inflammatory properties (138, 139).<br /><br />Studies specifically on tea flavonoids in test tube and animal research found that tea flavonoids may help maintain proper immune response by helping control inflammation (138, 139, 144) and by reducing the production of proteins involved in inflammation (145). These properties suggest that tea flavonoids help improve resistance to infection. Research conducted in test tubes and small pigs suggests that tea flavonoids may also help sustain a healthy gastrointestinal tract by promoting the proper balance of bacteria in the colon (146, 147). Emerging research has also found that tea antioxidants can inhibit the growth of unhealthy bacteria and promote the growth of good bacteria in the gut. In addition, recent test tube-based studies have found that tea flavonoids can kill bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers (148, 80, 149).<br /><br />Theanine, a unique amino acid found in tea, activates specific cells involved in the \"first line of defense\" cells of the immune system, which may reduce the risk of viral and bacterial infections (127). This suggests that regular tea consumption may help support the body's immune system. Researchers from the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University recently published new data indicating that theanine can help the body ward off infection and disease and may strengthen the immune system (150). In a follow up human clinical trial, published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, these researchers showed that after drinking 20 ounces of black tea daily for two to four weeks, participant's immune cells produced two - four times more interferon. Interferon is a protein that helps strengthen or improve the body's immune response. Coffee had no effect on increasing the production of interferon (127). While research on effects of tea on the body's immune system and its potential to help protect the body is just emerging, experts are encouraged by these promising results.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Tea and Appearance<br />------------------<br /><br />The possibility that green tea helps with weight loss has been a recent topic in the media. What is the potential role of tea in helping maintain healthy weight? Unsweetened, fresh-brewed tea, both black and green has no sodium, no sugar, no fat and virtually no calories, yet tea is a satisfying, aromatic beverage. This makes tea an ideal choice for a weight control plan that is part of a healthy lifestyle, especially when substituting for other sugar sweetened beverages. Another factor to potentially helping maintain a healthy weight is that regular tea contains caffeine which has been shown to increase energy expenditure (number of calories burned)(17,18). In a study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, consumption of 3-4 servings of oolong tea was shown to increase energy expenditure and the rate of fat breakdown. In addition, subjects drinking tea spent energy at a 3% faster rate and burnt about 70 more calories a day than those consuming water (57).<br /><br />Some emerging research on energy expenditure conducted with tea and tea extracts has suggested that increases in metabolism and rate of fat breakdown may not be solely due to caffeine in the tea. One study measuring the effect of green tea extract on energy expenditure in people showed that drinking either caffeinated water or tea extract significantly increased the number of calories burned, but in addition the rate of fat breakdown was significantly higher for participants drinking tea extract than those drinking the caffeinated water(58). In a second study researchers looked at group of flavonoids in tea and its effect on weight loss and body fat. They found significant weight loss and a significant reduction in total body fat in the people drinking tea flavonoids (equal to 3-4 cups of tea per day) when compared to participants drinking the placebo (66).<br /><br />While this is active area of research; the preliminary evidence suggests the tea drinking can increase energy expenditure and fat burning. However, there are no conclusive studies that tea drinking has beneficial effects on weight loss. Still, tea is a satisfying, calorie-free beverage that can be substituted for sweetened beverages and is a delicious alternative to plain water in a healthy weight management plan.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Lipton's Unique History<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Sir Thomas Lipton was a Scottish-born entrepreneur and innovator who decided in 1880, at the age of 40, that he would make tea accessible to all at acceptable prices and with a guaranteed quality. Before Thomas Lipton, tea had been expensive. It was a beverage for the rich and variable in taste as a result of improper packaging and transportation. Thomas Lipton acquired tea estates in Ceylon (today Sri Lanka) and organized packaging and transportation at low cost to sell his teas 'direct from the tea garden to the tea pot'. In 1893, he established the Thomas J Lipton Co., a tea packing company with its headquarters and factory in Hoboken, New Jersey.<br /><br />LIPTON teas were an immediate success in the US. Thomas Lipton was knighted by Queen Victoria, who made him Sir Thomas Lipton in 1898 at the age of forty-eight.<br /><br />Thanks to Sir Thomas Lipton, LIPTON is the world's leading tea brand and present in more than 80 countries.<br /><br />LIPTON. The company that serves tea to the world.<br /><br /> Reinventing Tea<br />------------------<br /><br />Sir Thomas J. Lipton pioneered many practices in tea manufacturing and the company he founded has continued this tradition of quality and innovation:<br /><br />  * 1890: First manufacturer to buy his own tea estates to ensure quality and consistency<br />  * 1890: First manufacturer to sell tea exclusively in packages<br />  * 1906: Created first British blend of tea to be imported into Japan<br />  * 1910: First to use printed tags with brewing instructions<br />  * 1944: \"Brisk\" tea launched in US<br />  * 1954: LIPTON introduces the Flo-Thru double-chamber teabag<br />  * 1964 LIPTON Iced tea mix introduced in the US<br />  * 1972: LIPTON Iced tea in a can introduced in the US<br />  * 1999: LIPTON Cold Brew launched, iced tea prepared with real tea in cold water<br /><br />More than 100 years of \"firsts\" and innovations has enabled LIPTON to bring more tea enjoyment to more people in the world than any other tea company.Sir Thomas would be proud. But he wouldn't let us stop here. In that spirit of tireless inventiveness, research and discovery, LIPTON is helping to shed more light on the exciting health benefits of brewed black and green tea, including the protective qualities of flavonoid antioxidants.<br /><br />LIPTON. Constantly reinventing the way the world enjoys the goodness of tea.\n",

Ironically, on the box it says its thicker and bigger, but I found it to be just a tad too small for easy use as a 13 gallon bag.  After applying it to the trash can, the first 4 or 5 things you put in pull the whole bag down with them.  So I am in the habit now when I have a new bag to gently place the first few objects in the bottom and be prepared to reset the bag anyway.

      "Got this as a Christmas gift as I put it on my wish list. Looked pretty good. Within the price range of family.<br />However, I am used to buying premium tea from other sources. And now I know why and why I will continue to do so.<br />I was first shocked to find that the tea was in shards, crumbled pieces. This takes it down a notch for experienced, premium tea drinkers. It makes one think we're getting the leftovers of the higher grade harvests. When infused, the leaves maintain a flat, crumbled shape, they don't unfold into beautiful leaf structures. I believe this hinders the flavor of the infusion.<br />The flavor? The madarin is very nice. A pleasant, citrus flavor, subtle, delicate. However, it's difficult to detect a very noticable white tea flavor. Contrary to popular opinion, white tea does indeed carry a sweet soft tea flavor. In some ways the citrus notes overpower the tea flavor. Perhaps this is to cover up a lower grade white tea harvest.<br />It's not horrible, just disappointing. But, you get what you pay for and three tins at the price offered, you'll get a lot of cups of tea, just not the best quality. BTW, you can infuse this tea more than once, but if you want to save it in another container in the refrigerator for the next infusion, be prepared to have to scrape it out of the tea strainer because it infuses flat against the screen.\n",

If you have ever tried to reuse a k-cup you'll understand what this coffee tastes like.  I did an experiment weighing five different brands of coffee and found all to be 1/2 oz. or more except Brooklyn and it weighed one tenth of an ounce.  That's 1/5 the weight of Dunkin' Donuts, Newman's Own, Millstone and 1/6 the weight of Starbucks.  This is the second time I've ordered coffee from Amazon and found it to be lacking.  Since they won't take returns, (even from prime members) I don't think I'll order any more coffee from Amazon in the future.  The reason I titled this review the second worst coffee was because I got tricked into buying a coffee that was really just instant coffee in a k-cup cartridge.  On second thought that actually was better than this.\n",

They are using soy protein isolate, which probably met two of the manufacturer's goals:<br /><br />1) Vegetarian/non dairy<br />2) Save money -- that is one cheap-o source of protein<br /><br />Although we all know that an alternative -- WHEY protein from cross-microfiltration -- is the highest form of protein available right now, it is expensive.  It is more easily assimilated than soy, causes fewer GI issues (gas, indigestion, etc.), and has a better amino acid profile, etc., plus has little to no lactose remaining.<br /><br />\"Instead of using destructive chemicals, cross-flow microfiltration uses filters to separate protein from undesirable fat, cholesterol and lactose, based on molecular size and shape.(18) The low-temperature process isolates the native protein of whey at its biologically natural pH, carefully preserving its biological activity. GMPs and other immune-boosting components remain intact.\"<br /><br />informational reference:  www &lt;dot> sportswhey &lt;dot> com/science_ion_exchange.htm<br /><br />Aside from the problem we have with the grossly inferior form of protein they are using, our main reason for stopping with this product is this:<br /><br />>>>>> We don't want our cancer to return. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />We have had breast cancer, and it was estrogen positive.  Our oncologist has indicated that while foods containing soy are ok in reasonable amounts, SOY ISOLATES ARE NOT SAFE FOR THESE TYPES OF CANCERS.<br /><br />Research backs this up.<br /><br />These bars are possibly cancer-promoting in the sense that they have estrogenic-effects.<br /><br />Women who are at risk for breast cancer (and who knows how much of the population this includes -- we don't know until after we have gotten it most of the time) SHOULD NOT BE EATING THESE BARS.<br /><br />Maybe they can put a warning label on them to say women should check with their doctors before consuming them.<br /><br />The research on this is readily available on the Internet, and my oncologist has studied this issue extensively.<br /><br />We are sad to give these bars up because they were our favorite in terms of flavor.\n",

      "After doing a lot of research, I think we can settle on this food for a while. I was previously feeding my dog Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul but my dog did not really care for the taste. I decided to try Taste of the Wild and he absolutely loves it. I have a 65 lb. Catahoula-mix who has a lot of energy and gets plenty of exercise -- therefore, I feel comfortable feeding him such a high-fat food. If I had a less active dog or an older dog, I would be reconsider whether this is really the right food. I've read many reviews online of this food which advise feeding slightly under the recommended amount because this is a pretty calorie-pacted kibble but you'll have to adjust the amounts to meet your dog's needs.<br /><br />My dog runs to his food bowl now and eats every last kibble bit. I can't honestly say that it's made a difference in his coat yet, but he's only gone through one bag (which lasts us about 2.5 months).<br /><br />Since I ordered my last bag, the price of this food has gone up about $6.00. I hope the price increases don't continue, needless to say.\n",

I left in on for about 5 min as I took a slow massage shower.

It claims 7 days I think it can happen.<br /><br />I don't have to wash everyday so 7 washings will be more than 7 days.<br /><br />I will buy this again and the price cannot be beat.

That's fine, but it melts all of the ice in the process (makes sense, it's brewing hot coffee directly over a cup of ice). So then you have to put several more ice cubes in the cup in order for it to actually get cold and for the ice not to melt. The good news is that even with all that melted water the coffee isn't too watered down. I'm guessing it's more concentrated to account for adding all the ice to it. It still tastes great and I'll definitely keep buying it-  I just hope I can keep up with filling my ice cube trays!\n",

I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips.

I contacted Beefeaters and they have not responded. This company is advertising falsely and making a huge profit on this garbage!! Save your money and start looking for a new product.

Though it is expensive, we figure we spend the same amount  or less than we would through purchasing a cheaper food as we would need to feed more for the same caloric intake.  We get by with a thirty pound bag about once a month or so.  Our lab's coat is healthy, he has high energy, and his \"movements\" are solid... May be too much information.  However, that is one of the big differences I notice with cheaper dog foods.  To help with further comparison, our lab is 8 years old, is an active hunter nine months out of the year (waterfowl spring and fall, rabbits, upland birds), and he is an indoor family dog.\n",

Outstanding job to Winona Ryder as Lydia, the misunderstood teen ager who no one appears to understand.<br /><br />I give this movie two thumbs up, one scene in particular that still cracks me up is when they brought back the couple, Alex's character begins to speak and his jaw falls off... not to forget the beloved scene when Beetlejuice is sitting next to the Witch Doctor and steals his number, the head shrinking scene is just too funny for words.\n",

I brew mine on the largest Keurig water setting (it makes about 1/¼ cups of brewed tea) and sweeten it with a half teaspoon of simple syrup which I keep in container in the fridge.  With ice, this mixture makes about 1 and a half tall glasses of tea - adding a healthy squeeze of lemon, of course.<br />I'd actually stored my Keurig away a couple years ago because I prefer brewing my own coffee, I find it far superior to the coffee produced by the K-cups (maybe I just haven't found the right blend yet).  Now I have a renewed use for my Keurig!<br />Edited to add:  It's fascinating to read the reviews for this product in the two-pack version; amazingly, it gets super high reviews while this SAME PRODUCT in the single box gets ratings that are poor.

The Mighty Leaf pouch has won awards; it is made of a biodegradable and compostable corn-based material, and it's beautiful as well. The pouch has lots of room in it for the tea to unfurl for richer flavor. No glue, no staples. And it's stitched with unbleached cotton thread; the company is careful with details to maximize your tea drinking experience and to keep it healthy for you and good for the environment.<br /><br />The tea is full-bodied, rich, and smooth. You can taste the vanilla in it, but it's a clean and subtle taste, not artificial tasting like some vanilla teas. It is my favorite vanilla black tea, and one of my favorite all-time teas. It was the first Mighty Leaf Tea I've ever tried, but it won't be my last.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****\n",

      "I love these chocolate fudge bars. Unfortunately, all six boxes, from two different deliveries, had to be thrown away.  There was powder all over the outside of the bars.  The box was not wrapped in any covering, taped close.  So, even though the expiration date is July 7, 2011, they all had gone bad (rancid).<br /><br />I have informed Amazon about this situation and hope that they will be able to correct it.  They were very good in refunding my money, but that doesn't help when I need the product.<br /><br />I suggest that nobody buy these chocolate fudge bars.  I don't know if there is a problem with any of the other flavors.<br /><br />I have requested that Amazon let me know when a new shipment arrives, but I don't know if that will actually happen.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRIBC0\">thinkThin Chocolate Fudge, 2.1-Ounce Bar (Pack of 10)</a>\n",

The berry flavor is the best selling flavor at the moment for every energy shot, not just 5 hour.  Five hour is still leading all energy shot products and companies.<br /><br />I've tried the product and sampled the product with distributors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers.  It is the best tasting of the 5 hour line of shots.<br /><br />As a consumer, the formula works and you will see an increase in energy as soon as you zip this 2 oz shot.  It is easy to drink and strictly an energy product. Many people tell me they don't like to drink the 8 oz, 12 oz or 16 oz energy drinks to get the same energy they can get by just carrying and drinking a 2 oz shot.<br /><br />As a wholesaler or distributor you are guaranteed turns with this market leader. The challenge is purchasing it at a competitive price.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jorge S. Olson<br /><br />Jorge S. Olson is a beverage consultant and entrepreneur.

I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is, even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure. I closed the lids tight.

      "Yes, it's on the salty side (most soups are), and yes, it's quite oniony.<br /><br />One thing I've always missed from my pre-veg days is chicken noodle soup. This soup overall isn't exactly like the real thing (no chicken broth taste, after all), but the fake chicken chunks are so realistic in taste and texture that the first time I tried it, I had to check the ingredients to make sure it wasn't actually chicken. The noodles are the texture I would expect, just like in a can of condensed chicken noodle soup. The broth is more oniony than I would prefer, but I assume it's made that way to make up for the lack of chicken broth... and I would rather have an oniony broth than one that was too watery or too spicy/herby.<br /><br />This soup immediately became one of my favorites. I mix crumbled Ritz crackers into it and, despite being a slow eater, I always end up scarfing it down in five minutes and wishing it wasn't gone already. So I'm really surprised that a few people here say it's so disgusting they had to spit it out. I'm not sure why that would be the case... unless they really hate onions, or they have a very low tolerance for vegetarian knockoff products.<br /><br />So basically I think this is a fantastic soup and I'm really grateful that there's a product that fills the void of the nostalgic Campbell's chicken noodle soup from my early days. But if you're not a vegetarian or you hate onions or you don't like salty stuff, you might want to buy a single can in a local health food store to try this out before you commit to a whole case of it.\n",

I've bought many, many bottles of very expensive white truffle oils in glass and and have returned several completely dead ones over the years. While I generally favor products in glass, the truffle aroma is an incredibly volatile (anyone who has left a bottle of truffle oil in a cupboard for a few months has probably noticed most of the aroma has dissipated) one and possibly labile under exposure to light. In any case, I've never had a dead bottle of this brand. Also, I have for years stored my truffle oil in the fridge; great to preserve the aroma but, if the carrier oil is olive, this poses a big problem of convenience as olive oil will harden under refrigeration.<br /><br />The big benefit of La Tourangelle is in fact the safflower carrier oil a it does not harden at refrigerator temperature or, if it does, it does so over weeks or months and I usually reach for mine every few days. Also, I just think it silly to bash this stuff for the neutral character of its carrier oil as I'm using truffle oil for truffle aroma. If I want really good EVOO character I'd rather choose the oil myself rather than leave that decision up to the truffle oil producer (and what is the likelihood that someone who doesn't specialize in olive oil is going to use the best one).<br /><br />Ignore the misinformed food snobs. Buy this, use it, store it in the fridge between uses.\n",

That's what Vines are supposed to taste like!!! they were SO soft and I could chew them without getting TMJ. I realized that all Vines are not created equally. I thought, \"hey maybe my first Vine batch was a bad apple\" and lo and behold, my next batch arrived last week....I rushed to open the package and taste the chewy goodness I experienced from my local drug store Vines and NOOOOOOO Hard as a rock! I value my teeth so I am going to cancel my subscribe and save on these Vines. I will pick them up at my local drug store where I can squeeze the package and make sure they are fresh and not going to give me lock jaw.

However, the flavor is not the same, that's why I can't give them 5 stars.  These simply don't taste as good as the Maynard's, Bassett's, or some of the other kinds that can be found at European candy stores.<br /><br />The price on these is so incredibly fair that I had to give them 4 stars.  Also, once you've eaten a few of them and you overcome the initial expectations, the flavor actually begins to improve and they can be enjoyed quite vividly.

It's understandable that different flavors keep coming out and if a supermarket is to carry every flavor of Cheerios it would have to dedicate entire isle for all varieties of the brand!<br /><br />Luckily Amazon carries it and price is reasonable. 5 stars for both the cereal itself for the Yogurt Burst lovers and Amazon.\n",

      "One of the questions that people are sure to ask about hemp oil is whether it has any psychoactivity. The answer is no.<br />Hemp oil contains 57% linoleic (LA) and 19% linolenic (LNA) acids, in the three-to-one ratio that matches our nutritional needs. These are the essential fatty acids (EFAs)-so called because the body cannot make them and must get them from external sources.<br />I use hemp oil in salad dressings, give it to my puppy with his food, and just drink it from the bottle with my vit E, CoQ10, Selenium, ALA, & a-d cocktail. Doesn't taste that bad either, didn't notice any nutty flavor or get high. But we don't go there anymore.<br />Amazon.com has a great price on the 24oz. bottles (Nutivia Organic)\n",

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

      "Being that I am a diabetic, I love Crystal Light, usually. This mocktail of Margarita was the lone exception. The first thing that hit me upon tearing open the packet and pouring it into my pitcher was the raunchy aroma. Usually the Crystal Light smell is either pleasant or non existing. This Margarita mix smelled horrible. I went ahead and added water and shook vigorously to blend the mix well. I then tasted the concoction: not bad. It does have a nice sweetened lemonade flavor. It does not taste like a cocktail at all though. It does not taste, to me, like a virgin Margarita even, just a blandish, sweet lemonade type of flavor. Then came the gastric distress. Oh no! I drink Crystal Light every day with no ill effects; this concoction, once again, was the sole exception. I'll spare the details, but suffice to say that I am not willing to even test this mocktail again. I am back to my trusty Raspberry, Peach, or Lemon Ice Tea blend.

Not only did it have the worst stevia flavor (grossly sweet and somewhat bitter), but the flavor also tasted really watered down to me. I think the Ginger Root Beer flavor could be really good if it was sweetened with something else and the non-stevia flavors came through a bit stronger.

      "Vitamin Squeeze is a good means to improve nutrition and liven up the taste of plain, boring H2O. Just a small squeeze is all it takes to add vitamins and flavor to a glass of water, encouraging better nutrition and more frequent water consumption- two things we could all use more of in our diet.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is a great idea in concept and it is more economical than purchasing vitamin- enhanced water. It does add some good amounts of key nutrients to your water; namely, Vitamin C, four different B vitamins, chromium, and zinc. It doesn't add any sugar, carbs, fat, or calories so it does have many things going for it from a purely nutritional standpoint and some would be wise to consider it for this reason alone.<br /><br />So, with so much going for it, are there any drawbacks to this beverage enhancement? Yes, there are exactly two and the one that will concern most is the taste. It is fruit punch flavored, but the taste is not very natural and it isn't very appealing. And since it is made with sucrolose, there is a slight aftertaste.<br /><br />The other thing that annoyed me about this beverage is that it doesn't define exactly how much you need to use for a standard serving. The instructions just tell you that one squeeze will do the trick, but it doesn't say how large a squeeze actually is. When you consider there are 12 ounces per bottle and that one bottle is good for 24 servings, you then figure out that a squeeze equals one- half ounce. Also, if you look at the nutrition label, you will see a serving size indicated. Thus, you will eventually figure it out, but it would have been nice if the manufaturer was clearer in this regard.<br /><br />In summary, Vitamin Squeeze isn't the greatest tasting beverage additive, but it doesn't taste terrible and it is still better than a glass of plain water. With the added nutrition and lack of fat, carbs, sugar, or calories, it has enough going for it to recommend and it does make a nice alternative to wasting so much money on individual bottles of vitamin- enhanced water.\n",

The rest of the 15oz. pkg. goes into the freezer, whereupon the next day I'm able to snap each strip into thirds - that's how Ranger Bob (my dog) likes it.  Might not be a bad idea to offer it this way for smaller dogs.  Oh, and one last thing, Ranger Bob will bury pig ears, real bones, biscuits,\"green bones\" etc. but not these Dogswell strips!\n",

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

      "I've enjoyed an Orange Pekoe and Black Tea blend for years.  About eight years ago, I was introduced to an Indonesian brand that was a blend of Orange Pekoe, Black Tea, and Cinnamon.  It was incredible!  However, it was bought at a discount store and I was never able to purchase it retail - despite my dogged attempts.  Ever since, I have been forced to go from one imitator to another looking for a replacement.<br /><br />Enter Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice which I first purchased at a specialty store that carried somewhat exotic products and have since purchased on Amazon.com.  What can I say other than WOW!!!!  This tea has such an INCREDIBLE taste.  It is almost indescribable how beautifully the black tea mixes with the cinnamon and orange in your tea cup.  I love the cinnamon taste so much, I actually OVER steep my tea bag in order to infuse as much of the powerful cinnamon taste as possible.  I'm sure many tea enthusiasts in the UK and here in the US would be aghast at the thought of over-steeping tea as normally you would be left with a strongly bitter cup as the black tea would infuse too much of its taste into the water.  However, this does not happen with Harney & Sons.  Instead, the only thing you get is a stronger and stronger cinnamon & orange taste.  I steep my tea so long that I often have to reheat my cup, but it is so utterly delicious (that would be the basking in fields of flowers with rainbows and unicorns kind of delicious) that I'm willing to wait another minute or two.  Add a little sweetener and a touch of cream and its TO DIE FOR!!!<br /><br />As you can see, I can't say enough good things about either Harney & Sons teas in general or the Hot Cinnamon Spice blend in particular.  I was so happy to find this tea - it truly blows away any brand that I've found - one of the many instances where you win when you pay for quality!\n",

Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a \"Bold\" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right\n",

      "I have been happy with the Neuro brand drinks since I tried them the first time at a deli in Manhattan.  I bought a stray Sonic and Sleep or two a few times to help me study and sleep and found them both to be very effective.<br /><br />I am a medical student in the middle of my clerkship year with an old habit of sleeping at very odd hours that really do not match up with my clinic schedule.  When I feel groggy and crabby after getting too little sleep, getting up early, and then having to stand quietly through a 4hr surgery, lecture, or conference, a Neuro Sonic at lunchtime totally gets me ready for the rest of the day when beforehand all my body wants to do is crash.<br /><br />Also, regarding the taste (I read the 1* reviews that complained about it), I find it to be very tasty, but then again I like the taste of Red Bull too.  The two don't taste alike really as Sonic is sweeter with a little more fruit flavor to it, but it's a similar type of 'energy drink' phenomenon where the taste isn't 100% like snapple or orange soda.  Bottom line is that if you're interested pick a single up somewhere and give it a try -- like I said I personally find the taste refreshing so there's more than one opinion out there.  I came here to order a case because buying singles is somewhat of a hassle and I'd rather have them ready to go in the fridge.  It kind of stinks that I can't get them at my local grocery yet, and for cheaper than $30 no less, but I like the product so okay.\n",

This isn't one of those cases though.<br /><br />First, the taste of the dressing is very tart. We're not talking mild 'dress up'. Somebody at the product production factory got a little too carried away with the recipie creation. So even people really liking blue cheese flavor (such as myself) are going to grimace when eating this stuff. Pouring it down the kitchen sink might be a better option.<br /><br />Then, detecting cheese flavors themselves become hard when there are little to none cheese chunks actually appearing in the product. It was questionable practice back in another era, but today definently, merely having a tart salad dressing should not count as having produced a blue cheese salad dressing.<br /><br />When other shelf dressings have actually now mastered putting detectable cheese chunks into their dressing, Wishbone would be wise to copy their playbook and upgrade the quality of it's recipie.\n",

      "In a world toxic from factory farming, unnatural additives/feed (mad cow anyone?) making sick cows (RBGh and pus in the milk) I avoid any dairy not from grass-fed cows. If you shop organic, you know how expensive this is for animal products.So far as I know, goat dairy is free from these evils.<br /><br />I tried goat products after reading a couple books on natural diet and healing by Dr Jordan Rubin. \"The Maker's Diet\" is good, but the protocols repetitive, and he is of course promoting his products he designed to recover from Crohn's. Coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself. Anyhow, it helped me, improve my health too.I find I have less congestion, allergies, and sinus problems.<br /><br />The \"goaty\" flavor can be overcome by a gradual switchover mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use - be it cow's, soy, rice. After a while you will not notice it much, then you may like it! I bet after a month or two of no cow's milk, you will taste \"cowy\" flavor in it. Our tastebuds change.<br /><br />I like both the evaporated and powdered milks. My cats do too - and it has been okay for feeding a sick cat who couldn't manage solid food.<br /><br />I am going to make some cultured goat milk products, since yogurt is over $2 a plastic cup in Ohio.

After that, it was back to the normal amount to suds up my hair.<br /><br />When I first used it, I noticed that my hair felt a little drier and stripped. This is something that I notice every time I use a different brand of shampoo which I thing is just the feeling of the built up old product getting washed off my hair. With repeated use, this feeling went away.<br /><br />I also used the corresponding conditioner. Within the first couple days, I noticed that my hair felt thicker and softer. The ends of my hair still have the remains of some bleaching and are drier than the rest of my hair. They felt smoother after a couple days of use.<br /><br />The only negative thing I find is that my hair gets greasy faster with the use of this shampoo. The only thing I can think of is the extra nutrients that are supposed to help the scalp is just adding too much to my all ready normal scalp.<br /><br />Over all, this is not that bad of a product. I like how my hair feels softer and seems to have more volume without drying out the ends further. Using the conditioner does help the ends too, more on that on the other review. But I do admit that I wouldn't get it again just because of how greasy my hair gets with it.<br /><br />I think if you are looking for a product that will help your dry hair, this is one to look into.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.\n",

      "This might be handy for someone who wants a convenient, pocket-able, quick treat in a training situation, but otherwise I fail to see the point of this product.  Although it's low in calories, it's easier and cheaper just to use a few of the dog's kibbles for treats, subtracting them from the dinner allotment if calorie count is an issue.  If your pet doesn't eat kibble but you still want to give treats, I don't think this offers anything that any other tiny treat doesn't offer.  It's actually less convenient to hold the Lickety Stik for your dog to lick than it is to just toss a treat.<br /><br />Also, the first ingredient listed (this is the Savory Chicken flavor) is \"natural chicken flavor.\"  Do a little reading and you'll quickly realize this doesn't necessarily mean an actual chicken was involved anywhere in this product.  Aside from that there is cultured lecithin (I have no idea what the \"cultured\" modifier means in this context), vitamins E and C, rosemary extract, and green tea extract.  None of this sounds harmful, but none of it sounds particularly nutritionally helpful, either.<br /><br />As far as dogs' opinions, we had an even split at my house.  Both dogs thought it smelled good and eagerly licked it initially.  One dog has not only refused it since that first taste, but actually pulls back from it when it's offered (and this is a dog that eats anything -- animal, vegetable, mineral, paper towel, cardboard...).  The other is happy to lick from it until I take it away.  I'll probably let her continue to use it until it's gone, but I don't see myself adding more of it to my pet-treat cupboard.\n",

I have purchased almost all that are offered, either they are very short cups, strong, but bitter and you have to use 2, to get the cup size you want, so then the price is not so great.

First, I love the easy to use applicator. Once open, you can part your hair and apply the oil to your scalp, not your hair. After applying a small amount, which was super easy with this applicator, to those areas on my scalp that felt a little dry and itchy, I simply massaged my scalp and styled my hair. Secondly, I didn't find it to be too greasy, but maybe that was because I was placing the product directly to the scalp and not to the hair itself. Third, I didn't mind the smell. Unlike some who have reviewed this product, I didn't find it too overwhelming (it is tropical smelling), but again I was only placing a small amount on the scalp. Finally, I found the product to be affordable and comparable, especially when compared to other hair oils. Overall, I thought this product did exactly what it said it would...it provides nourishment to dry itchy hair. I give it a 4.\n",

Jasmine in teas can often overwhelm the flavor and end up tasting more like cologne than a cup of tea.<br /><br />The folks at Rishi clearly know their teas and how to blend them.

I love tea, all kinds of tea and drink it every day, for more years than a lady cares to reveal.<br /><br />The high quality of the long leaf is impressive. The jasmine is just right, a subtle fragrance that enhances the brew and does not overpower it.

In fact, I much prefer my regular conditioner Aussie Moist to this. It takes twice as much of this conditioner to get it through my hair and remove tangles that it does my Aussie. Afterwards, my hair feels good, but no better than it does with my regular conditioner. What I especially don't like is that the conditioner is tinted pink. I have light blonde hair and I don't normally use conditioners with dyes because they stain my hair. It has been years since I have even seen a conditioner with dyes in it. I thought that went out of practice in the 80s.<br /><br />Overall, I would not use this again. There are better conditioners on the market and I would prefer something without dyes.\n",

      "I got one bag as a sample for review and tried giving one of the treats to my dog, but she wasn't willing to give it a serious try. I let her keep it for a week and every once in a while she'd toss it around the living room or pick it up and carry it around for a minute, but she never made any real effort to eat it.<br /><br />I ended up giving 2 of them to my nephew's dog, and he seemed to like them all right. I took the remainder to a playdate my dog was having with 3 other dogs and out of those one chewed on one a little but didn't seem awfully interested, one took no interest at all, and one really liked them. I tossed the bag after the playdate, forgetting that I'd want it for reference, but I seem to remember not being very thrilled by the ingredient list either.<br /><br />The final tally for me was 2 dogs out of 5 who seemed to like it, 1 who thought it was okay but nothing special, and 2 who didn't have any real interest.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with these at all and I can't see myself recommending them to anyone. Given that my own dog wouldn't eat hers, I definitely won't consider buying them in the future.<br /><br />Edit: Leaving my original review intact, but reducing from 2 stars to 1. I just heard that the dog that liked these the most was chewing on it a while after I went home and started whimpering. Her owners found that her gums were bleeding. It might just be a random thing that she bit at it wrong and no fault of the treat, but given the other problems people have reported having with these I wouldn't want to gamble on it. I'm definitely not going to be recommending these to anyone.\n",

I no longer purchase any corn product that isn't organic and non-GMO--for safety's sake. This mix makes good corn bread with pleasant texture. Thank you, Arrowhead Mills, for providing a safe alternative to \"mutated\" corn products! Thank you, Amazon, for selling it via Subscribe & Save.  The best of both worlds! I encourage anyone concerned about food safety to switch from traditional corn products (read:  GMO corn brought to you by Monsanto, makers of Agent Orange, and drenched in Roundup, one of the most toxic substances on earth today) to Arrowhead Mills organic corn meal mix (which cannot contain GMO corn and meet organic standards at the same time).<br /><br />I realize I used this review to get up on my soap box, but so many people are unaware of the dangers in our food supply.  Europeans have said NO to GMO seeds, but Monsanto has a headlock on the American government today (with a former Monsanto attorney running the FDA!) and that \"evil empire\" is determined to take over all the seeds IN THE WORLD by patenting their GMO seeds (which REQUIRE that Roundup be used with them).<br /><br />PLEASE search out information about the dangers of GMO seeds on the Internet and learn why all consumers should fight the GMO invasion and insist on GMO labeling. The first step toward ridding the world of this danger is the California ballot to force labeling of GMO seeds (tantamount to putting a skull and crossbones on the product label!). Once this passes--and I believe it will--governors in other U.S. states may stop being such cowards and follow suit!<br /><br />CITIZENS FOR SAFE FOOD SUPPLY--UNITE!

      "This chili is pretty good for canned stuff. I ordered this chili almost a month ago and it has been sitting in my pantry until tonight when I finally got the courage up to try it. I am not really sure what I expected. I have vague memories of canned chili from my childhood and it tasted a lot like an old sock in a tin can. I was pretty scared to try this stuff out. But things seem to have improved since the Time of Cave Man and this Chili is not bad.<br />When I first tasted this, it seemed really good, but then I realized that I was really hungry as I had not eaten a real mean, even a canned one, in two days, so I was prepared to adjust that opinion.<br />After, the first few bites where I was in the \"starving\" mode I began to notice some other qaulities that were not solely based on How Good the Chili tasted. The next thing I noticed was a pronounced Saltiness. I believe you could leave this stuff stored and salt alone would keep its shelf life good for years. That is how it tastes. The can states that it has 45% (or 1080 mg of a total 2000mg) of Sodium/Salt. It also states that it has less than 2% of salt. That may indicate that, by volume, salt is less than 2%. And that is true. But the average person should have no more than 2000 mg of Sodium/Salt a day. So I do not know who did their math, but 1080 is slightly more than half of 2000, so the RDA should be about 54% not 45%. Take it from me, this stuff is salty. I had my crackers out to eat with my Chili and after a couple of crackers, I ate Chili only. No need for crackers. A shame, as Chili is best with crackers. But they are not needed; in fact, it is painful to try to take in more salt than the Chili itself gives you.<br />The next thing I noticed was that the Chili was sort of \"gummy.\" The consistency is not quite right. Chili, right off the stove, has some \"soup\" to it. This does not. It is closer to the consistency of gumbo or chowder. It is quite thick. I am not used to it, so I felt it was a bit \"too full\" or \"gummy.\" Others may not be used to that small amount of soupiness. But, which ever side of the fence you eat your chili on, this is not the soupy side.<br />The consistency that I experience as gumminess may be fat. The Chili has 15% of your daily allowance of fat. That is a whole lot of fat for a 15 ounce can. That means 10% of the can is fat. That makes my arteries shudder. The only ingredients are water, beef, beans and crushed tomatoes plus spices. The only thing on that list that has fat is the beef. So, they are not using the best grade of beef in the world. But, then goodness, this is Canned Chili. That must be where the lower quality beef goes! Into my canned chili!! It certainly is not the beef that I put in my own personal chili!!!<br />So, that about sums it up for the Canned Chili. The taste is pretty good but salty. You get more than half the salt you need in one day from this can. Forget the crackers and the chips for today. You also get 15% of all the fat for one day in this can. The percentage for the fat is not so bad as the percentage for the salt, but if you think of 10% of the can being fat, it is not quite so appetizing as it once was. But then again, I point out that this is Canned Chili. The Health Nuts of the world are not out eating it. It is those others of us who won't or don't cook, and who are not really into all that health food suff. That is who eats Canned Chili.<br />So, for Canned Chili, I give it four stars. I knew I wasn't buying the most healthful stuff to start with. Really, I just wanted to have something to eat on the nights when nothing else was available. So, I figure, I really do not care about all that health information. I am just ticked because it is too salty to allow me to crush my crackers up in it. Dang! Chili without crackers!! So, four stars it is. I would give it three and a half and take off for the fat, the salt, and the less than perfect taste, but they won't let me do that. So, go ahead and give this a whirl. I'll eat it every two or three weeks. If you have to eat it more often than that, I recommend Something Else to protect your arteries and kidneys. Perhaps a salad would do the trick. So, eat it, but not too much of it!!!!\n",

It's light, crispy, holds up well under heavier toppings such as vegetables, and is low calorie.  However, I found this product to be too salty, even for a confirmed salt lover such as myself.  The salty-garlic flavor can overwhelm many toppings, especially those already containing salt.  A fresh, sliced tomato with herbs, no salt, is fine...adding a little salted hard cheese such as Parmesan decimates the flavor of the cheese.  I ordered a subscription because the price was fantastic, but I'll be cancelling it and replacing it with another Kavli crispbread product.\n",

Recently someone told me to try a particular Sumatra, said it was the \"best\" and it was nasty, I tossed it out. Very bitter, it should never be bitter.<br /><br />His birthday is tomorrow and I had to get him another medium pound, but I also added this dark roast. WOW. I am in love!<br /><br />It's the best. Now that I understand how subjective coffee is, we all like diffrent beans, blends,roasts, some in my family like added flavors (shudder), i think good coffee has enough flavor by itself and only inferior needs additives.<br /><br />I love darker roasts, creamy, chocolately, luscious. This is all you'd expect.<br /><br />Having now tried both, all I can say is you will really enjoy both types, but love the roast you normally prefer.<br /><br />The price can't be beat and they don't charge you high S&H rates, that's a nice feature.<br /><br />I hope this helps.\n",

All the others tasted bitter or had a significant unpleasant aftertaste.  I have been using Pyure Organic in tea and oatmeal and find it to add just the right amount of sweetness with 1-2 packets.  Since I knew that the product was exactly what I wanted, I ordered the 3,000 count food service size since it was the most economical.  I actually bought the 3,000 count Pyure Organic from Amazon/PYURE BRANDS&lt; LLC, but it seems that the 3,000 count is no longer available through Amazon, so I am posting a review here since it essentially is the same product.<br /><br />Some of the packets had some problems like previous reviewers mentioned-contents caked together, some packets with little or no product inside.  I contacted Pyure Brands and told them of the situation.  Chelsey, the Customer Service rep who answered my email, apologized for the inconvenience, and IMMEDIATELY SHIPPED OUT A REPLACEMENT ORDER.  She also sent me a prepaid label so that I could send back the Pyure I had, inspect it, and resolve why some of the problems mentioned above were happening.  There was absolutely complete trust in what I said, immediate concern, and prompt corrective action taken to fix the problem.  I am convinced that because Pyure Brands is a relatively small American company, they are trying to a better job than their mega-corporation competitors.<br /><br />Where there a few problems?  Yes.  But since I gave them a chance, Pyure Brands came through in flying colors.  I have never written a review before.  The reason I am, is because I firmly believe American companies can provide the best products with the best Customer Service to back them up.

I'll update later with continuing status.<br /><br />Great product!<br /><br />EDIT: The branches of the tree were all curved up and the foliage's shape didn't look as great as I'd like it when the tree arrived. However, the branches lowered into much better positions in a few days. Now the tree looks gorgeous, and I'm not sure I'll trim it at all! It was the secure packaging that caused the branches to look mooshed, so wait a few days before you decide upon a foliage verdict (or begin trimming).<br /><br />I forgot to mention before, the tree is planted in a sandy soil to ensure optimal drainage. I water every 4-5 days by immersing the lower half of the bowl in water for 15 minutes.\n",

The picture on the front of the can looks a lot like what I call Hummus, thick and creamy, full of healthy ingredients.  When I opened the can to eat it I was quite surprised that the \"Hummus\" was really really watery and looked like it was better suited for drinking than for dipping.  It wouldn't stick on my carrots and you certainly couldn't spread it as nothing would stay on a knife.  I'm not sure if I just received an off batch or if they are trying to get more profits by watering down their hummus, but that was a big disappointment and I would never buy this brand again or recommend it to anyone!\n",

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying \"chip\" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.\n",

      "First thing is first. The value for this bag is EXCELLENT. 5 lb's of rawhide from grass-fed cows that aren't bleached for around $25 is one of the best deals out there. It's the epitome of why Amazon is Amazon. I always come to Amazon to search for the best values on products that I use daily in my life to see if I can lower my overall expenses via buying in bulk.<br /><br />When I got this bag in the mail I was shocked at how large the back really is. 5 lbs of rawhide is a lot of rawhide!<br /><br />I have a small chihuahua that is about 8 lbs. So, needless to say, I expect a 5 lb bag to last at least a year, even with me giving some of the bones away to friends.<br /><br />My dog is a chew FREAK. He is always chewing on some form of rawhide or bully stick and after doing some research I saw that there were different types of rawhide. Some were bad for dogs due to bleaching and coming from unhealthy animals, so I found these, which *seem* to be from healthy cows and in their natural state.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, the chips can be really thick, which is really nice. It gives a nice sturdy chew for your dog to enjoy and is a good size.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />I am editing this because I previously marked these down because my dog was ignoring them. Since that time my dog has gone through quite a few of these and they've turned into an excellent treat for him.<br /><br />These chews have caused no issues with him health wise - not a single one. I've given some to my friends and their dogs have loved them too. They have no odor, they don't get too \"slimy\" like some chews can get and when he gets to the \"end\" and there's just a little bit left it becomes really soft and he's able to chew it until it's small enough for him to finish and I don't worry about him choking because he's really good at chewing something thoroughly before swallowing and they become really soft.<br /><br />So, I take back my lower rating and give these a 5 star because they've turned into a great treat for the price and I still have a whole bin full of them after all this time (small dogs have their perks).\n",

      "I want to say THANK YOU to happybaby for making the organic sweet potato puffs that are gluten free.  My son has severe milk, egg, and oat food allergies.  The irony is that these are labeled as a \"gluten free\" food, but it is also free of the other allergens. It is very hard to find a product that satisfies his allergy needs.  Everything is either milk free and has oats/wheat... or gluten free and has milk protein.<br />We buy this product in bulk from Amazon and will continue to do so as long as they continue to be milk, egg, gluten, and oat free!<br />I'd give this product ten stars if I could.<br />THANKS again to happybaby and thanks to Amazon for making them available in bulk at an affordable price!!!<br />(PS. If your child has food allergies, please read the label and don't take my word on it!  They could always change the ingredients.)\n",

They actually tasted like an over spiced molasses cookie which makes me want to end my life not enjoy it like the label states.  I laugh now that the box claims to be even tastier, so before they must have tasted like ass.  They smelled great and sounded promising so I thought that I was going to end up finding a new cookie obsession.  I guess it is a good thing for my wallet that I didn't find a new cookie obsession but my taste buds are angry.  Buyer beware, don't expect chocolate chip cookies because these are anything but.\n",

      "Nov 2010: Still love this coffee!  I just signed up for monthly shipments, having run out last month and been forced to go back to the Senseo brand pods. Yuck!  Well, they are OK until you've been spoiled by these.  With the monthly shipments, the price comes down to a few cents over $20 bucks a pack and *FREE SHIPPING*!  How can you go wrong with that?<br /><br />I only wish they had a nice sampler pack with maybe 3 varieties of pod and that they would add Ethiopian Yrgichieffe as a flavor.  That's one of my favs.  So what if it's hard to pronounce?  It's great coffee!<br /><br />Original review:<br />Some of the other reviews and other similar items had me very confused as to what I should buy (or even if I should just keep buying Senseo-brand pods at the grocery store).  So, I took a chance with one order to see what I'd get.<br /><br />First thing to say is that the coffee is delicious.  I am so tired of only having a limited choice of flavors with the supermarket brands.  Even the supposed premium varieties leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The Sumatra Mandheling pods from Java One taste great!  Not only are they a nice change for me, but the quality is excellent.  Each pod is individually sealed in a pouch and one order contains 14 pods per box, with 6 boxes in a case.  That is 84 pods total at a cost of about 23 cents per pod.<br /><br />The box says that each pod is good for an 8-ounce cup, so that's how I prepared my coffee.  I have a large 16-oz mug and normally would use 3 pods of the Senseo brand (one double-pod holder that I run on both size settings and one single-pod holder that I only run once at the larger cup size).  Doing that fills my mug about 3/4 of the way and leaves room for cream, plus some dead space above.<br /><br />With these pods, I used the single-pod holder and only the large-cup setting, but ran it twice, changing the pod in between (are you following me?).<br /><br />That filled my mug almost up to the top, leaving just enough space for my cream.<br /><br />The coffee was among the best I have made, ever.<br /><br />So, not only is each pod only 23c, but I only have to use 2 pods (46c) to make what used to require 3 of them (at an approximate cost of 29c each or 87c for my mug) to get the taste I wanted.\n",

      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is \"All-Natural with Vitamins,\" that there is only \"1 calorie in every 10 licks\" and that there are \"over 500 licks per bottle.\"  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.\n",

Blue Diamond is my favorite go-to snack for salty, spicy, or sweet while on the Keto diet, so of course this flavor had to be good as well.<br /><br />The first bite gives you a delayed reaction, from \"hmm, I guess this is alri-ohhhh there it is!\". Once the flavor hits your taste buds you are able to truly appreciate the flavor. It tastes just like you are eating some dark chocolate. However, unlike the Emerald almonds, it is not a bitter chocolate taste. It's sweet and delicious!<br /><br />I would say it is probably my second favorite \"dessert\" flavor - just under the Butter Toffee.\n",

      "These gummies are something that we do not want the radical islam terroist to get there hands on. From what I know now, there are no secrets that would be worth keeping, if they threatned to make me eat the gummies. First my head was on fire and my ears were pulsating. I looked down to see if someone by accident had stuck a brading iron through my stomach. It took so much energy away from me that I crawled to the toilet. This kind of diarrhea made me think of a new invention.... seat belts for the toilet. I had such diarrhea that I was producing thrust. Just as I was about to pass out, the noise from my ringing ears distracted me enough to not pass out and realize that ther was more thrust coming. Just as I thought this was over the finally came with dead lips. Yep my lips went numb like I had a shot of novacane. This was the conclusion and after my wife said she could now see my pupils again and my eyes came back down in alignment. At this point we told the 911 operator that we were going to hold off on the ambulance.<br /><br />T. Williams, an ex gummie bear purchaser.\n",

      "I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts.\n",

      "I got these treats for my extra large Chihuahua who will eat anything.  She wasn't a fan of these.  Whenever we decide to give her a treat we ask her if she wants a \"snackee\" & she gets very excited.  She'll run in circle & stand on her hind legs.  When we gave her this for a \"snackee\" she just looked at it, smelled it & then looked to us like we were joking her.  We left it there & she looked at it again & smelled it & then chose to walk away from it.  This dog turns down nothing except for lettuce.  After it sat there for about 30 mins I put it in her dog dish & about 6 hours later she decided to get it out & contemplate eating it for about 10 more minutes before she decided to finally try it.  She did finally eat all of it but we know she wasn't big on it because the next couple times we gave her one it was the same routine, it sat for hours before being eaten.<br /><br />Her opinion is that she's not big on them & wouldn't recommend them but if given one she'll eventually eat it to make it go away.\n",

      "I love to make pulled pork sandwiches. It's very easy by putting in a 3 - 4 lb cheap cut of pork like a Boston Butt in a slow cooker along with 14 oz of beef broth on low over night. Then, remove the meat from the pot and put in it a baking dish. After it cools, pull it apart with forks and mix in a bottle of BBQ sauce and bake in the oven for 30 minutes.<br /><br />I decided to try this BBQ sauce for a change for my usual Sweet Baby Ray's. The other versions of Stubb's might be very good as I have not tried them but I found this to be way too boozie. That was about all I could taste. I love a little bourbon in BBQ sauce but it was extremely over-powering in this.\n",

However, packages kept costing over $50 to send! So I saw these and decided to try it. The packaging is NOT from Britain, it's in a whole 'nuther language, so I opened it and tried it anyways and I PROMISE you, I compared the TRUE cadbury flake to this one and there really wasn't too much difference in taste, you'll find that most chocolate will taste like it may have melted a bit somewhere along the way, UNLESS you pay about $30 extra to send it overnight in a cold package (trust me, I do that often with chocolates from CT to TX)<br />I would (and am again) purchase this, it's still better than (one of my faves) Hershey chocolates and beats the cadbury products we have here. Maybe it's the texture, but it's pretty good PLUS I save an extra $50 just by ordering it from here.\n",

      "These baskets are great. Stylish and reasonably priced.<br />I do wish they would sell them in higher stacking sets. As this product is made, the best you can do is buy two of these two-basket sets.... and use the top basket from the second set as your third tier. Of course that leaves you with an extra bottom basket.<br />Let me explain. The bottom basket and the top basket are not the same. The top basket is made in a way where it snaps onto the rails of the bottom basket. The bottom basket does not have that hardware on it. So if you buy two sets, you can only create a 3 tier basket. That is.... if you want all the tiers to properly snap together.<br />Personally I took the bottom basket from my extra set and stretched out the legs to be wider than the opening of the basket. I used that as my top (4th tier) basket by letting friction do the work and fitting the legs into the top rail opening of the 3rd tier. It's not the most stable thing in the world.... but it doesn't fall down either.\n",

However, stating that the 9.5 pH is good for you is completely devoid of any scientific substance. In fact, there are a lot of scientific studies that completely refute these claims. There's a page by a retired chemistry professor, who rips into the variety of similar \"alkalanized\" and \"ionized\" water marketing claims. Most importantly, his page contains a lot of links to University and other scientific research results that all undermine the important of the 9.5 pH. Having said all that, I do like the taste of Essentia water, so whatever minerals it has in it does make for great tasting, pleasant to drink water. Just don't fall for the pH hype until and unless you read the science reports instead of trusting any marketing hype.<br />[...]\n",

      "I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these \"bones.\" They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had \"doggy breath.\" I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath \"fresh\" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.\n",

However the fascination ended for me once the steaming cup met my lips and the tea itself passed over my taste buds.  To be fair, perhaps I am not discerning enough or just not attuned to the nuance and subtlety of white tea, but I found the taste to be washed out & weak - even on the first pot.  I suppose it is unique enough to warrant a try if you are so inclined, especially if you can get it on sale.  I paid less than $15 for the set of nine flowers and pot.

I am not saying this is terrible as it does provide some flavoring after using a lot of product but I wish it was better. However, I am quite pleased that there is no fat or cholesterol regardless of however much I use which is something that real butter or almost all butter imitations can never achieve. My advice: use it if you absolutely must (such as in the case of my dad) but don't expect the same flavor as butter because there is slight taste to these which is nowhere near the real taste of butter.\n",

Price Foundation.  I've just completed some research on their site, and others, and discovered some disturbing facts about this so called agave nectar.  It has a quite dark history.

I believe it is better to have all the information available to weigh against the agave industry's partial truths.  One article even suggests that current agave syrup labeling does not conform to FDA requirements.<br /><br />The consensus of non-vested conscientious science is that agave syrup is another bad guy.

Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.\n",

You get a lot of snack for the calorie content.  I think they are very comparable to PopChips but you get a much bigger portion(1.1 oz. of Smart Fries for 110 cal vs. popchips - 100cal for 0.8 oz.). I like PopChips but I'd rather be able to have more snack for the same calories. The Honey Mustard & BBQ flavors are delicious & were my favorite.  If you're a chip addict like I am, this is a good deal.  It was a big enough serving to satisfy my craving without completely blowing my daily calorie intake.  I will definately purchase again.\n",

It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here.

      "This is still better than Canada Dry.  When I lived as a child in the Detroit area (mid 1950's through about 1963 Vernors was available only in the greater Detroit area and southeastern Michigan.  You never forget the taste of your favorite soda as a kid, and I hahven't forgotten what Vernors USED to taste like.  About 12 years ago I found it here in California.  But it is next to impossible to find, and with most stores it's an on and off again availability situation!  However I just opened a can of regular Vernors a few minutes ago and am reminded that the formula has changed DRASTICALLY.  Mostly it's MUCH MUCH weaker tasting than when I was a kid.  It's mostly plain soda water... with only a HINT of the original Vernors than it was 50 years ago.  I still like it, but am VERY disappointed that since vernors was taken over at least twice over the years, that the owner has chosen to weaken the flavoring CONSIDERABLY.  Maybe they will see the light.,, but that is extremely unlikely considering who owns it now.  Vernors was I believe only second in sales around Metro Detroit (Coca Cola was first) 50 years ago. The reason I rated it at 1 star is because it's so MUCH weaker now. It originally used an extremely secret recipie that was truly in a high security vault.  Also it is NOW artificially flavored which means the entire formula has changed except for the fact they still use water! That is the only similarity vernors still has with the original formula. Perhaps the new owners have thrown away the old recipie.  It (was) the oldest soda made in America.  I say \"was\" because the REAL Vernors no longer exists.\n",

      "I didn't have this flavor specifically, but this drink is great. It really does relax your mind & body and any stress will melt away. If you're trying to get a marijuana \"buzz\" from it though, it's not like that so don't expect it. It's great because it's all natural too! I drank about 1/4 of the can and waited a little bit just to see how it would effect me the first time. It did relax me, and it also made me pretty sleepy. Not like \"falling asleep while doing something\" sleepy, but \"as soon as my head hit the pillow, I'd be asleep\" sleepy and that was just with a 1/4 of a can! I drank the rest the next night and the \"sleepiness\" wasn't nearly as prominent as the night before, but it definitely relaxed me. I don't know if this would be a great thing to drink just to relieve stress, like during the day, because of the melatonin in it. I found this in a local natural food store and only bought one can..now I'm wishing I bought the whole shelf! I will definitely drink this nightly once I get more. If you're looking to unwind at the end of a long day, without drugs, alcohol or harsh chemicals then this is definitely for you. I was skeptical at first because at $1.75 a can, (& I didn't even know if it would be worth it), to me, that's money I could be using toward gas, lol! Anyway, it was worth it and I can't wait to get more!\n",

      "I'm somewhat ambivalent on this product; you can tell from the get-go that it is quite mild, almost gentle on the taste buds (and almost nonexistent on the olfactory senses). It comes in a 3 ounce foil sealed packet (I got 10 in a set); the coffee is very fine (almost like dark brown sawdust from a 320 grit sandpaper).  I would compare this product to ganocafe classic; the two are similar in texture and flavor (except the ganocafe comes in 1 ounce packets and has no caffeine).  One of my slight problems with this product is it comes with NO DIRECTIONS.  I assume you just measure out what you would usually mix for your coffee and put in your drip coffee machine and process as usual.  However, the ganocafe just mixes directly with hot water (very convenient if you are on the go or whatever); I have the feeling you can do the same with this product (just mix directly with very hot water).  The question is how much product to what quantity of water should the ratio be (ganocafe is one ounce to 6-8 ounces of water).  I guess one of the true tests of coffee is how does it taste (or can you even drink it) when it is cool (not iced, not hot); this coffee is still drinkable even when cool.  If you are looking for a product that will not mess up your stomach, I think this product will do the trick.  (However, as a final plug, ganocafe will also do the same thing; however, ganocafe is expensive, and you have to go through a bunch of hoops to get it--like become a distributor, buy at least 60 dollars a month of the product, etc.--I did for a while, accumulating years worth of the product--since it is in tiny foil sealed packets, it will last for years).  Note the four stars is primarily because I believe the product will do as advertised (the low acid amount) and the taste is acceptable (true connoisseurs of coffee will turn up their noses at this product). UPDATE:  I got sample packets; the \"regular\" item DOES COME WITH BREWING DIRECTIONS.  You also can't brew it directly in a cup (just add hot water will not work without complications.  Their phone connection system was excellent, no automated garbage, quick real live person with answers who actually lives in the U.S.  Oh, ALL coffee has some caffeine, just how much (sorry about my earlier comment). One final thing, there is a cold brew coffee  technique called Toddy Coffee; you just put a pound of coffee in a special plastic container, put in some cold water (first 4 cups, then 5 more), let it sit for 10-12 hours, and drain through the filter at the bottom.  You then heat up water and put whatever amount of this dark liquid in the water (usually two parts water to one part liquid coffee. This cold process coffee is extremely mild, much like puroast, except you have your choice of which coffee you want to use.  The downside is you have to use a full pound of coffee (well, you can halve the recipe), and you don't get that much actual coffee (liquid).  Still, it tastes great.\n",

However, my curiousity was piqued when I saw these badboys at my local Target, and my friend Charlie being the generous man he was, bought me the Caramel Tim Tam, he bought the regular. When we got to his place that night, we tried them, and I was hooked. The chocolatey goodness surrounding two crunchy wafers, a creamy filling in the center, and of course the caramel which is chewy after a few seconds, talk about silky and heavenly! Of course, the regular ones kick ass too so you know. But seriously these things just rock.<br /><br />Everything about this cookie/biscuit is high quality, the chocolate is very tasty on all counts. The wafers have a crisp unlike anything I've tried before in my life, and the chocolate cream is wow, and the caramel, it starts off a bit hard at first, but softens up after a few seconds in your mouth. Minus that part for the regular Tim Tam, but you got the idea basically. Long story short, Tim Tams rock, and you all need to slam a few down.\n",

DVMs across the US were finding that it was taking<br />more of the barbiturate to euthanize the pet because the pet was being fed a small dose in its food on a daily basis,<br />due to the rendered animal fat found in about 25 dog foods, including Nutro.<br /><br />Dried Beet Pulp is the by-product that is left over from the processing of sugar beets, they extract the sugar, and what's left<br />is beet pulp (usually fed to pigs as it's cheap), but in dogs (which are carnivores) it's INDIGESTIBLE & produces gas (which<br />can cause gastric torsion - fatal if not caught & repaired via a DVM surgery in time) and beet pulp produces a FALSELY firm<br />stool, causing you to believe that your beloved dog is healthy because he's pooping some firm poops.<br /><br />No, the dog can't digest the beet pulp, it dehydrates the dog & passes through like a bale of hay....<br /><br />A good dog food contains WHOLE ingredients (not meal), no fillers, no soy, corn or wheat, whole fruits & veggies, no<br />salt and should contain whole turkey or chicken, whole herring and cottage cheese.  Your dog does not need salt if<br />the food contains whole veggies, potatoes, whole fish or cottage cheese, as those foods naturally contain salt.<br /><br />Natura Pet makes Evo (grain free), Innova, California Natural, and their pet food (cat, dog, ferret) contain 100%<br />HUMAN GRADE ingredients... \"natural\" means nothing.  Natura sells to mom & pop pet food stores, not chains or<br />supermarkets, because their food is preservative free, very tasty & HIGHLY caloric, so feed 1/2 the amount that<br />you would normally feed.  On Evo & on Innova your dog will poop 75--50% less stool volume because there's no<br />fillers and it's digestible.  These foods produce a glorious coat & even the pickiest eater will eat them.

      "My husband found this sugar-free chocolate with hazelnuts at a German deli here in town. It's made in Croatia, of all places. I'm a chocolate fiend and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur. Since going low-carb, no sugar, I have sampled all kinds of sugar-free chocolate. This one is pretty good. The hazelnuts are chopped and add a lot to the flavor. The chocolate flavor is light and not real chocolate-y (which I would like) but it is still tasty. I like that the sweetness is not overpowering. I've noticed that many sugar-free products from Europe are not as sweet as here in the US and they are much better, they don't knock you over with maltitol. The price is reasonable and fair. There are some truly crummy and awful sugar-free chocolate items for sale out there but this is NOT one of them. It's not a product to swoon over but it's a pretty good substitute when you want a chocolate treat at a good price. I hope you try it and like it.\n",

      "Hey, they have a cool commercial, right? And, the colors they used for their liquids have a bright, almost day glo quality to them. But, you taste this stuff and its horrible. If you ONLY use a little bit, it tastes like very watered down coolaid. One of the problems with this MIO liquid, is that if you follow the mixing directions from the commercial \"Use a little, use a lot..you decide\" you could put in two squirts for a glass of water. If you happen to do that, it doesnt taste strong, it tastes WRONG. I actually got sick to my stomach from drinking this stuff, and never drank it after that. Even watering down what i made too strong, couldnt make a drink that I could stomach. However, I did wonder why it made me sick, and looked up what the manufactorers stuck in this bottle. The main ingrediant is MALTIC ACID (C4-H8-O7), which is an organic chemical that occurs in fruit (apples). Next up is PROPYLENE GLYCOL (C3-H8-O2), which is anti-freeze. I know its used in some flavorings, but probibly not at this strenght. Next up, is Citric Acid (C6-H8-O7), which is in citrus fruits, as well as a common preservative. Its sweetened with Sucralose, and contains less than 2% natural flavors. So, its up to you. Maybe you are living or working in a situation, where you are required to drink tap water that has worst tasting chemicals in it, than you have in this MIO LIQUID. In that case, it might even IMPROVE the flavor of bad tap water. However, if you can avoid it, stay away from putting organic chemicals into your body that are better used for industrial purposes, or car engines. In fact, buy a squeeze lemon, and some artificial sweetener, and make your own flavor called lemonaid. Or, drink pure, clean, filtered water. I can only relate my experience. If mixed weak, tastes like watered down coolaid. If mixed strong, turns your stomach. (and yes, i have a strong stomach.)\n",

You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.

      "Of all the \"Subscribe and Save\" products, this is the one I've been waiting for -- Rosarita refried beans are a real staple, my #1 comfort food and #1 earthquake-preparedness food. With my Prime membership this works out to about a dollar a can, which is a decent price, and these cans are heavy to lug home on foot from the market! Add a tablespoon of chicken stock or water if the beans are too thick for your tastes. They're ideal with scrambled eggs, you want them to make a burrito out of, they're great on their own, maybe with some salsa or grated cheese -- I really love these beans. Very highly recommended! I'd read that Californians who had moved with their jobs back east to the Carolinas would have people visiting California ask \"Do you want me to bring you some beans?\" -- they're that iconic and that good.

You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just \"lick\" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange \"treat\". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.\n",

I know, because I personally tried them before giving them to him. I looked over the ingredients before purchase. (Apparently, some of the other reviewers on here did not. Their problem, not yours/ours.) It says in red letters on the container for this flavor, just below the ingredient list: \"Contains wheat. No dairy. No corn. No soy.\" It also says that of the flavors, only Strawberry and Sweet Potato are gluten free. If you're concerned about ingredients in the foods you give your child, it's probably a good idea to read the ingredients first.<br /><br />The initial taste is a touch sweet, followed by a mild toasted flavor. Kix is the same way, only many times more intense. I like that if you just put them in your mouth and provide moisture and pressure they dissolve easily. I also like that they have the choline, and are sweetened with juice not sugar. Even if my son hated these, I'd probably snack on them myself. LOL.<br /><br />There you go.

It was fantastic! We decided it will probably make a better iced tea than hot but still, very good. I love that the Rishi brand comes in it's own sealed tins with instructions. Highly recommended for anyone who likes floral teas!\n",

      "When I pop in an Ice Breaker's Frost Mint, I get the sensation... OF BEING ON A FROZEN MOUNTAINTOP!!!<br /><br />It's been about two weeks now since I made the tragic choice to bite into an Ice Breakers Frost peppermint, and still I haven't made any progress in finding my way out of these blasted mountains. The only food I have is the rest of this pack of Ice Breakers Frost peppermints, which, unfortunately, when I eat one, keeps bringing me right back up to the top of these mountains. They are just TOO. DANG. REFRESHING. I think? I saw a sherpa once? but it could have been the statue I made out of the mints, out of desperation for some company, as I'm getting so awfully lonely. My only consolation left in this world is that, should I not find my way out of these cursed mountains, I will leave this world with cool, fresh, minty, wonderful breath. Please, tell my family that I love them, and, if they chose to eat Frost Mints, they should first tether themselves to something extremely heavy, lest they, too, get whisked away to some frozen mountaintop.... like me.....\n",

      "Ever since I was a kid, I've loved Kraft mac and cheese.  Granted, the years have probably faded my memories, but I sure think that this tastes just like the stuff my mom used to make from the box (and I later made from the box when I was in college).  Unlike the box version, I can make these easily at work - woohoo!  I can store these in my desk drawer, and either one or two packs serve as a plenty satisfying lunch for me.  I've never had any issues with making these, with the recommended 3.5 minute cooking time being just perfect.  So simple to make - pull off the plastic seal, remove the packet of powdered sauce, add water to the clearly marked line in the cup, microwave for 3.5 minutes, add the powdered sauce, stir, and enjoy!<br /><br />The only downside to me is the disposable container for each serving that isn't readily recyclable in a lot of places (it's type 5 plastic).  Like many here, I'm much more conscious of my environmental impact than I used to be.<br /><br />If you watch for sales, you can get these for a good price.  I ordered them from Amazon for under 60 cents a pack, but they are almost always available for at or under a dollar a pack at the stores around me.  To me, that's a great price for a quick and satisfying snack/lunch.\n",

      "Before buying this product, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough variety.  When I received the package which contained the K cups packed into a brown paper lunchbag [they did indicate that this is the way they are shipped], I was very excited to see what flavors were inside!  It felt like Christmas morning.  I was pleased to find that all of the K cups were intact and there were a wide variety of flavors, including seasonal and special edition flavors.  Yes, there are a few flavors that are in particular abundance, but they are the most commonly enjoyed flavors so I think it is reasonable.  There are a lot of Green Mountain flavors which I have no problem with because Green Mountain coffee is excellent.  I was happy when I saw 2 Timothy's Kahlua K cups because that's a flavor I've really been wanting to try!  Here's the tally:<br />Green Mountain Coffee French Vanilla 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Hazelnut Noisette 6<br />Timothy's Kahlua 2<br />Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry 4<br />Green Mountain Coffee Gingerbread 2<br />Gloria Jean's Mudslide 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Caramel Vanilla Cream 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Mocha Nut Fudge 1<br />Total 35<br />That's right... I ordered the 34 count and they sent me 35.  The 35 count is $2.12 more than the 34 count on Amazon, so this decision definitely paid off!  That was generous, or perhaps clumsy of the sellers.  Either way, I will take this in a positive light.  Overall it was a good purchase!\n",

The can lost 2 oz. of weight.  With the prices of cat food going up and up, I want more not less.  Don't misunderstand me, this is a fairly good product, a little low in fat, but the cats love it just the same.

I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.  One day I came across this one at the grocery store and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I've long enjoyed Stash teas for their quality, which is pretty incomparable.  I generally prefer loose teas to bagged but Stash is one of those rare teas whose flavor isn't compromised by the bag.  I found this to be the case with this particular tea.  It's not a very complex flavor, which is why I wouldn't give it a full five stars.  However, it is very mild and has a nice, subtle nutty flavor.  It's definitely a good tea for those who are new to greens as when it's brewed appropriately it has none of the bitterness or strong grassy flavor that can sometimes come through in greens.  It's an easy drinking tea and I sip it throughout the day, to the point where I drink around three oversized mugs of it a day.  In light of this, I now order it by the 6-pack from Amazon in order to have a continuous supply.\n",

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.\n",

      "one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office.\n",

Thanks to several posters, I ended up purchasing this brand at Costco.  As a newbie I can't compare it to other brands.  Not sure whether I liked it at first, but after a little experimentation, I am now enjoying it.  First try, it seemed a little bitter to me.  Not sure if that's the brand or the nature of quinoa.  Then I read a recommendation from other quinoa users advising a 30 minute soak of the grain before cooking it to minimize any bitter taste.  This did seem to help.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because although I am satisfied with the product and the brand, I'm not sure of how it compares to other brands and also because price is much higher than Costco.\n",

It is the best thing that has happened for me and my cats in a long time.  It is pricey compared to the Costco cat food that I used to feed them (which according to a lot of people in my local feral rescue group is good nutritionally even though it's cheap), but well worth the money if it keeps them healthy.  I really can't believe I didn't try it sooner, but I didn't notice much hair in the vomit until recently, so never made the connection.  Still not sure if the vomiting problem is always due to hairballs, but this seems to be working anyway.  Must be easier on their digestive tracks, and they love the stuff!  Had no problem switching them over at all.  Didn't even mix the old and new foods, just put the new food out.  Once again well worth the cost if there is any way you can afford it and have cats with sensitive stomachs like mine.\n",

      "I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"\n",

      "I like giving my son (now 14 months) a variety of flavors throughout the week, and this is one in the arsenal of guaranteed-to-be-eaten foods.  He has loved sweet potatoes & apples since he was 6 months & starting solids.  I give him this and other Earth's Best cereals (Banana, mixed whole grains, etc) combined with whole milk, yogurt, wheat germ, etc.  THE KEY is he's not fond of his green veggies, but I can mix pureed asparagus, broccolli, spinach, etc. with the sweet potato Earth's Best and he's none the wiser & loves it.  For the multi-grian, I just add pureed pears, banana, etc with the pureed veggie to sweeten it up a bit (I get the Plum Baby purees for travel- another great way to \"hide\" the veggies-, or make purees at home in the blender & freeze).  This flavor cereal is not overly sweet at all (I've tasted it, since I wouldn't expect my son to eat anything I think is yucky-tasting).  I suspect that the other reviewer might've been jumping the gun on the solids, hence the poor response.  I've read that babies have more tastebuds than adults, so I can see their little palates getting overwhelmed by new flavors, but this cereal is *way* less sweet than any jarred banana or other fruit baby food, to give you an idea.\n",

      "I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.\n",

I use it to condition my hair (pre-wash, or use a little on the ends of hair after wash), moisturizer, make-up remover, and couldn't be happier.  It's so inexpensive next to all the other things I used to use, that now don't take up all that room in my bath.  I cannot speak highly enough about it as a beauty aid.  No more facial moisturizers, make-up removers, eyelash conditioner, body moisturizer, and hair treatments.  All-in-one, and perfect at all of it.  Then there's the smell of summer that it leaves on you and in your hair.  Gorgeous, I feel like there's a little piece of the Hamptons on me.  Only one thing wrong - if you're not looking to tan or burn be careful in the sun, it's an oil, folks.  Also, it's liquid in high heat, so pack it well in your suitcase.

Judging by the texture of the almond butter upon opening, it must have been quite a while. The texture is rather gritty, and very dry. It's almost hardened and cannot be squeezed out whatsoever. We tried to soften the spread by warming it in the boiling water with pouch intact but it had no effect. It was completely solid when we opened each pouch. You can't squeeze it out.

      "I took a cooking class when I visited Rome last year, and one of the things we made was fresh pasta.  The chef/instructor explained that in Italy flour is classified as either as type 1, 0, or 00. This scale refers to how finely ground the flour is and how much of the bran and germ have been removed.  The scale has nothing to do with the protein content - that is dependent on the type of wheat. Doppio Zero is the most highly refined - it resembles talcum powder - and is the choice of Italians for making both pizza and pasta.<br /><br />After learning how easy it is to make pasta, I bought a pasta maker the minute got home, and have spent the past year perfecting my skills at making it - it's so fun and easy once you get the knack.  I've been using all-purpose and semolina flours (or a blend of both) to make fresh pasta, and have been very happy with the results, but I decided to splurge on the authentic stuff.  The first batch I made with the 00 flour took me back to that cooking class in Rome and the amazing silken pasta we made that day - the texture is noticeably different.  I've also used the double-zero flour to make pizza dough, and the resulting crust was simply over the top.<br /><br />All-purpose flour is a perfectly acceptable substitute for authentic Italian 00 flour, and it certainly costs a lot less, but if you're ready to take your pizza and pasta making skills to the next level, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.\n",

I absolutely LOVED their product...in my opinion, the batter turned out flawless every time. When I saw this GF version at my grocery store, I was thrilled! Well I cooked up a batch this morning, and they were wretched. I have totally accepted the fact that GF foods are just going to taste/feel different than<br />'regular\" foods, but these were just so terrible. Not only was the texture very grainy and un-fluffy there was a very strange under-flavor. I always add just a drop of vanilla to my pancake mixes, so naturally I did with this too. When I tasted them, I thought I must have accidentally put half the bottle of vanilla in, before I realized that it wasn't quite the vanilla that made them taste so bad. I smelled the pancake mix, and discovered that the mix itself has a very floral-y or perfume-y scent to it. I have never used a pancake mix where the mix itself was scented. This was very strange to me, and I was just disgusted by the outcome, so I will keep searching for the perfect mix.\n",

The only things I found that I did not like were the part were the gum balls (I am using it for M&Ms) come out is even with the bottom. If it is sitting flat on a table, you cannot get your hand under the chute to scoop the gumballs or M&Ms into your hand. You have to set this up on something about 2\" thick with the chute hanging over the edge. The other thing is, when the items fill the chute and you flip up the plastic cover, you have to use a finger to scoop out the items onto your hand. It is a one or two at a time process because the plastic cover does not flip up completely out of the way. But, for the price, it is great. I have it in a senior center and a sign that says \"One Cent buys you a little bit of heaven\". That's for the M&Ms we have in there. We always make sure we have a roll of pennies to make change. They all love it and do not mind the two little things that I just mentioned.\n",

However, I still needed milk occasionally, and would buy it, use a little for whatever, then the rest would go to waste sitting around in my frig.  Not any more!  I just mix up a little of this great product whenever I need it (usually half the recommended amount) and keep it in a glass jar in the frig. I use my immersion blender and it works great.

I haven't been brave enough to actually drink a glass (and never did like drinking skim milk anyway), but it's perfect for use in cereal, coffee, and cooking.<br /><br />Milk has gotten so expensive, especially if you are buying organic because you are concerned about hormones and additives.One $10 bag of this product is going to last a long time and save me soooo much money!

I pour myself a bowl, add some milk and I am ready to go to town!<br /><br />Others have noted that they come with an expiration date that is far enough in advance so you won't have to worry about eating them too fast; and they are right.<br /><br />Overall, Frosted Flakes has always been and probably always will be my favorite cereal.

      "I really love this stuff. I have a very big yard, a demanding job, a chronically ill husband to care for and a 15 year old who is being home schooled. Needless to say, I don't have time to be in the yard all day everyday, but when we bought our first home in the winter I was stunned and overwhelmed by the forrest that grew in the yard in the summer. My neighbor gave me a really hard time about the weeds as well. We were first time home owners and didn't know what to do. My approach would have been to offer advice rather than pick a fight, but I guess some people would rather be bullies. But anyway...<br /><br />I did my research and found Preen which is just wonderful. I used the preen on the hill in our back yard and along the sides of my home where weeds grow. I did notice grass growing where I used the Preen. Apparently the weeds were choking out the grass. But I love how Preen makes my yard look nice and neat. Now my neighbor can shut her mouth about my yard and my yard now looks better than hers. Just wait until the summer when I mulch, plant, and trim!<br /><br />We have decided to sell the home though b/c it is too much work that I don't have time to do. Preen helped me keep my sanity though. I HIGHLY recommend it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is becaue I so wish it had weed killer and preventer as well. Seems when you buy the two combinations together the killer or the preventer action is diminished.\n",

      "I purchased the Starbucks VIA iced coffee on a whim at my local Starbucks due to it being on sale.  I love it.  I was nervous about the taste at first because it's pre-sweetened and while I do like sugar in both my hot and cold coffee, I don't like the excessive amounts that Starbucks packs into its bottled Frappuccinos at the grocery store.  The sugar content in those are outrageous.  The sugar in these instant iced coffees I can take and I would say it's half as sweet as the Starbucks bottled Frappuccinos, but still may be too sweet for some.<br /><br />There's one oddity about the pre-measured amount.  The directions say to add 16oz of water (and possibly ice), but most standard drinking glasses are just at (or slightly above) 16oz, so if you like milk or cream in your coffee you're going to have a hard time putting the amount you want without the glass overflowing.  Perhaps I'm one of the few that drinks iced coffee with cream, maybe?  I don't know, but it's annoying (lol).  Not annoying enough to rate the product below 5 stars, though.  Next time I may make a small pitcher of iced coffee by dumping several sticks in 48oz of water and then I don't have to worry about it.  ;)\n",

      "I should have known when I touched these strips.<br />They are rock solid hard.<br />Anyways I gave it to my dog for the first time, and it caused minor tearing and ulcers in her GI tract. I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-\n",

      "These tasty little treats are excellent for puppies.  They are easy to chew and great for their fragile teeth.  They are NOT messy and dogs usually take a whole day to chew one.<br /><br />I first bought a 15 pc. pack at my Vet. He said that this was great for small  dogs and puppies.  My puppie loved them.  But I had to travel quite a distance to my Vet. So I scanned Amazon to see if I could get them anywhere else.  Luckily, Amazon had it listed with a double pack (30).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, especially since it it Vet recommended and my picky dog loves them.\n",

      "If you live close to a Chinese market, you can find the same two products for less money. You can also find higher quality Oolong for 15-20 cents/bag (e.g. Ten Ren or Yama Moto Yama brands)... which are just as economical, since Pier brand takes 3-4 bags to reach the same richness of flavor as the others.<br /><br />If you tend to stick to Lipton and Stash brands, you will probably find these Oolongs refreshing and flavorful.<br /><br />My tea drinking credentials: I drink 3-10 cups daily and have two shelves of loose tea and 3 drawers of teabags. I prefer Oolongs to Black, Blacks to Greens, and have yet to taste a White worth the price.\n",

      "This is beautiful meat which was professionally sliced and packaged in cry-o-vac.  It was inside a foil pouch within the delivery box & dry ice had been included.  The meat was still cool & was sent by 2nd day air.  We had enjoyed this type bacon on a few occasions in Europe.  My first attempt at cooking it, it turned out just a bit dry.  I researched on-line and it suggested cooking it with a bit of olive oil.  It was perfect with that attempt.  The meat is mostly lean and as a cross between ham & bacon, it is definitely more like ham.  It has just the right amount of salt in it and I'm looking forward to many great meals as well as sharing some with family & friends.\n",

      "The mail carrier brought the package to my door because of the severe leakage showing through the bubblewrap envelope.  The fragrance was quite strong.  I have severe respiratory issues and I was affected almost immediately causing me to put the package and it's contents in the garage.  It was not an unpleasant fragrance, but not one I can be around, let alone try to use, and for that I am sorry as I wanted to try the product at least once and leave a review of how it was on my very dry scalp.<br /><br />I did open the bottle and saw there was no protective seal.  That should be addressed by the company in future packaging both for leakage issues and for consumer protection.<br /><br />There is no useage information on the bottle except for 1. CLEANSE  2.SMOOTH  3.SOOTHE  4.SEAL  (written exactly like that) on the outside of the peel-up label and on the back it says MASSAGE INTO SCALP AND HAIR.  I think the company can do a little better than that with instructions, especially for a new product on the market.<br /><br />There is an 800 number on the bottle I called twice to talk to customer service to tell them of the packaging as well as my allergic response, but both times I got an MCI operator instead of a Unilever representative. That was rather disconcerting.<br /><br />My personal experience with this product, even without being able to try it, was not a positive one, from the over-powering fragrance to the lack of instructions for use to a non-working phone number.\n",

The gentle sweetness and light caffeine hit the spot so well that I can finally kiss my calorie/chemical laden coffee + creamer goodbye and wake up the way I want to!

My husband and I have vastly different tastes in coffee/teas.  He is very, very picky about his coffee (Tully's seems to be the ongoing favorite) and I like anything fru fru and flavored.  Oh and tea.  LOVE the teas!  So I figured between the two of us we should like something?<br /><br />We got almost every single cup pictured and not a single duplicate cup!

Easy way to find out which brand I'll like best before committing to a full box!  The box was a bit jumbled but that was OK with us since there wasn't any explosions.  I really feel there's the perfect blend here between hard-core coffees, fru fru coffees and teas.  I can't wait to dive into this pack.<br /><br />Regarding the expirations - almost all of mine are expiring in August which is 6 months away and I feel is definitely fair given that there are a few boxes I purchased in December that are already expiring!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this pack and I would purchase this without hesitation for friends getting a new Keurig.

      "UPDATE  - I heard that Muir Glen had started transitioning their canned tomato products to BPA free cans but when contacting Muir Glen (General Mills), I kept getting a canned (no pun intended) response that they believe BPA is safe...blah blah blah.  But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free.  Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010.  Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner.  You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color.  I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping.  I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free.  Let me know what you find when shopping.<br /><br />I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay!  Thanks Muir Glen!<br /><br />Old Review -<br /><br />I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES--remember how many women died of cancer because of DES?) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen to see if they had any plans to try and remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. Some companies are concerned and working to remove BPA (Eden Organics) while others are defending BPA--they are the ones that really upset me (Del Monte and Coca Cola are some of the worst--I won't buy ANY of their products anymore). Eden Organics has removed BPA from their canned bean products and is working to remove it from their canned tomato products.  Vital Choices is the only company I know of that has gone 100% BPA free but they sell mostly canned fish and a few other products but no canned tomatoes.<br /><br />I have switched to fresh food or jarred foods--no more cans for our family unless they are BPA free.  The lids of most jars have a little BPA but so much less BPA is leeched out compared to a whole can lining, still I would prefer NO BPA.  It just makes me sick that I fed my children with baby bottles that contained BPA.  I gave my children synthetic estrogen!  We already have prostate cancer in our family, and now I have increased my son's chance of prostate cancer even more by using BPA estrogen laden baby bottles--ugh!!!!!<br /><br />Contact Muir Glen and tell them you want BPA free cans!  We as shoppers, have a lot of power if we decide to use it.  In fact, contact all the companies that you buy canned goods from and let them know you don't want to feed your family BPA anymore.<br /><br />Let me know if you find any tomato products (diced, crushed, paste, ...) that are BPA free by responding to this comment--I will get an email.  I desperately want to make my chicken cacciatore again!<br /><br />I just read some more about BPA, Minnesota has banned BPA and several states are also trying to pass legislation to do the same.  So write to your legislators about banning BPA!  I also read the following from Fran Pavley the sponsor of California's BPA ban:<br /><br /> \"Well over 100 independent academic and government peer-reviewed studies have linked BPA to a host of problems, including brain and developmental damage, breast and prostrate cancer, early puberty, obesity, infertility, miscarriage and hyperactivity. Young children and babies are particularly vulnerable because their body systems are still developing.<br /><br />Still, the chemical industry remains in denial. It has employed more than a dozen lobbyists to kill my bill.  Lobbyists for popular formula brands are roaming the halls of the Capitol, telling my colleagues that alternative products aren&iexcl;¦t available, and a ban on BPA could cause a formula shortage. Yet at the same time, these companies are marketing a variety of formula and food containers to parents as \"BPA free\".\"<br /><br />Scary!!!\n",

      "Thanks to Bloom for tracking down the 40 mg caffeine per piece!<br /><br />I need my morning caffeine, but coffee upsets my stomach and tea requires drinking too much volume.  So I wanted to try energy gum, did a little market survey of energy gums and picked this one based on low cost.  As an added bonus, it tastes fairly good.<br /><br />After completely making the switch away from coffee, I've discovered an added benefit.  Once you get calibrated as to how many pieces of gum you need every morning, it takes only ten seconds to pop them in your mouth and go about your morning routine while you chew.  This made me realize how much time I wasted every morning preparing and drinking coffee or tea.  After fifteen minutes of chewing, the gum is done and you can spit it out.<br /><br />I got an Amazon \"subscription\" so that they send me one shipment (2 boxes with 144 pieces each) per month.  That's very slightly more than I chew, which is perfect.  If energy gum is something that you're going to consume on a daily basis then price becomes important in selecting the brand and vendor.\n",

I put a thermometer inside to monitor those low temperatures... So far so good and I'm glad I don't need another device in the kitchen.<br /><br />Note that you need to start incubating at 75 degrees and then slowly raise the temp to 105, 110. Don't go much higher.. food enzymes start to die at around 116 degrees.<br /><br />PS<br />The only reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because the package did not give decent instructions for people working without the Yogourmet yogurt maker, and I wasted a batch by not cooling to 75 degrees. : )\n",

The granola has a great, chocolate taste without being too sweet, as well as a satisfactory crunch to it without being too hard on the teeth.  I'd say that Nature's Path did indeed come up with a 'unique marriage of taste and health' with this blend - everyone I had try it loved the flavor!  There are nice sized chunks of yummy dark chocolate in the tasty granola, and the only complaint I have about this blend is the red berries - I don't know if it's the bag I received or not, but they were a bit missing compared to everything else, just a few tiny pieces here and there.  Yet the granola is still delicious and I didn't really feel it lacking for their tiny presence (the chocolate more than made up for them), just be aware if you're hoping for nice big chunks in yours.\n",

      "I'm a mother of two young babies who were fed this formula for 6 months.  At the time I purchased and used this formula in 2009-2010, I was incredibly happy and confident that I had found the perfect formula for my babies.  It smelled and tasted different from other formulas that we had tried on our babies.  I compared all the nutrient labels and believed that it was equivalent to other formulas commercially sold.  I told everyone I knew about the product, encouraging other mothers to use it for their babies.  Since learning of the arsenic in Nature's One formulas, I'm angry and very scared about the possible health effects as a result of my babies ingesting this arsenic through the formula.  This is the only way I know how to deal with some of my emotions--let other mothers know about this very important issue.<br /><br />I'm not a \"hired writer\" (but I'm certain that the mere fact that I'll be accused of it again by the company and its followers will be enough \"proof\" for some).  This seems to be the common term the company and its followers are using on many of the online forums like Amazon and Facebook to label and harass mothers who have been brave enough to raise questions about the safety of the product.  For all the truly worried-sick mothers asking too many questions, this is a debate that must be carried on despite the tediousness of the continuous harassment by the company and its followers because the safety of our babies and an entire generation of people are at risk.  The company and its followers are successfully getting postings deleted from online forums in order to suppress thoughts and opinions that it doesn't like because they raise important and valid issues.  Apparently, we're asking some of the right questions--questions that require answers that the company doesn't want to give to parents.  It's not just about this company however.  This is just the starting point.  It's about getting the truth out of the FDA and getting our government to set definable and safe standards for arsenic in our food.<br /><br />First, as unfortunate as it was to discover that there is arsenic in baby formula, it is only the tip of the iceberg.  As I've devoted my time to researching and reading scientific papers and articles, I am just starting to understand that arsenic in our food supply is more prevalent and more dangerous than the public realizes.  The scientific communities around the world have been studying and writing about the dangers of long term arsenic poisoning from water and food for years, and yet it's a fact that most people weren't even aware of until now.  How many of us knew that the U.S. standard for arsenic in our water supply was set at the level it is now (10 parts per billion) not because it was the lowest and safest level that could be achieved, but because the government agency responsible did a cost analysis and determined that it would be too expensive to remove more arsenic than that from our water supply?<br /><br />I suppose it shouldn't be surprising given the fact that the FDA has been \"monitoring arsenic in foods for 20 years\" (yes, it has known about arsenic in chicken meat for years) but has never taken actions until now to limit this toxin in our food supply.  I guess that the majority of the public (who aren't involved in this debate over Nature's One's formula) will continue on with their lives without ever knowing about the negative health effects of ingesting arsenic every day through water and food.  The majority of us will live a reasonable number of years and suddenly find out that we have some form of cancer, and think it was predominantly genetics that determined our illness, never dreaming that it could've been the arsenic in our food and water.  Regardless of the reasons why the FDA and various agencies never acted to protect the people from arsenic toxicity, it's enough to know that scientific communities have been urging governments to set \"safe\" standards to limit the amount of arsenic consumption.  It's intolerable to think that the government has been allowing this to go on for so long.  Isn't it time that we demand better from the government of the greatest nation on earth?<br /><br />As I step back from all the debate over whether Nature's One's organic formula is safe or not, I realize that this will be an ongoing war of words.......with no immediate winners.  I imagine that the only thing we'll be left to deal with will be the long term health problems of a small percentage of babies who were unlucky enough to have been fed this formula.  It's sad to think that by simply refusing to admit that the levels of arsenic found in its formulas are unsafe, the company is possibly jeopardizing the health of many babies.  We as parents did the research on all the available formulas and decided to trust this company with our babies' health.  We believed that we were getting the best formula on the market for our babies; we trusted that this organic company was testing for dangerous toxins like arsenic in its products.  Naturally, we trusted, never imagining that an organic company would sell an organic product containing brown rice syrup that was made from rice grown in soil contaminated with arsenic.<br /><br />As of yesterday, the company has decided to release its test results on its website.  I read the numbers, and at first, it meant nothing to me.  I did some research and tried to understand what this truly meant.  From what I was able to find online, my understanding was that the WHO standards that the company cites as safe (2.1 mcg/kg of bodyweight/daily) were set in 1983 and were based on standards for arsenic in water that were much higher (50 parts per billion) than the current standard of 10 parts per billion.  Arsenic experts from around the world agree that this standard is outdated and needs to be revised using \"a firm scientific basis.\"  According to experts, this WHO standard is a \"fallback position\" due to the lack of current standards for arsenic in food, and not one that is necessarily safe.<br /><br />My fears about what the future may hold for my babies in terms of their health keep me up at nights.  I wonder, and I'm sad about what I might have done to them in my quest for the best.  I only pray and hope that all the babies around the world who were fed this formula will show the amazing resiliency of the human species, and that we as their parents will have the strength to deal with whatever may come.<br /><br />Articles:<br />\"Arsenic and Rice\"<br />\"Getting to the Bottom of Arsenic Standards and Guidelines\"<br />\"A Bitter Sweetner in Baby Formula\"<br />\"Arsenic, Organic Foods, and Brown Rice Syrup\"\n",

      "awesome product!  Try the Campbells Healthy Request Chedder Cheese Soup w/ the miracle noodles (rice noodles) instead of using the regular rice suggested on the recipe on the back of the can.  the recipe is for Chipolte Chicken and Rice.  We follow the recipe w/<br />a few changes:  saute onion and bell peppers (we use frozen ones if we're in a hurry for a quick meal) along with either Tyson's frozen pre-cooked and grilled chicken frajita , or 1 lb ground turkey.  Add 2 tbs. tomato paste, 1 can whole black beans w/ a pinch or two of salt and several shakes (to taste) of any mediterranean or morrocan spice blend.  we use \"morrocan twist spice rub\" or use a mediterranean spice mix we made at home from a recipe we found online.  add 3 bags miracle noodles (rinsed and heated in a pan to dry them out a bit), and 2 cans of the campbells healthy request chedder cheese soup and you've got a delicious winner that is a satisfying<br />delicious soul food easily kept in the fridge for 5 days and heated in the microwave as needed. guilt free! Yum.  hope you enjoy!\n",

All other store brands save this one, and ONLY this one, pale in comparison to my homemade cookies.  These are like the perfect balance of goowiness and crunch.

      "This is the second bag of coffee I have purchased from Coffee Bean Direct and they get a 100% approval rating from me! The prices really are great, and with the Amazon Prime shipping- the overall price truly can't be beaten. I love french roasted coffee- and this does not disappoint. If you do not like the smokey taste, then simply, do not buy any coffee that has the term \"french roast\" on the package!<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from a Papua New Guinean coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a smokey, chocolate-cream taste. If it were a wine, it would be a Pinotage!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct roasts their beans fresh to order. When I purchased the first 5-pounder in February ('11) of the Brazilian French Roast, it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in January. On this package that I ordered in June, it also had the roasting date of January. So, it appears that Amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago- be informed of that possibility.<br /><br />I have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened. Whatever you do- DO NOT REFRIGERATE OR FREEZE- that is some sort of urban legend/myth (lol) and actually speeds up the stale taste!  This is an easy fix!- Do what all coffee distributors do: store in a vacuum-sealed foil package. How? For the five pound bag, you will need about 10 gallon-sized VACUUM food storage bags (found in supermarket) and basic aluminum foil (also in supermarket.)<br /><br />1)Rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about 12-16 inches long<br />2)Lay foil flat on counter<br />3)Gently pour, roughly, 1/2 pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheet<br />4)Fold both of the width-side edges neatly over the center of the beans<br />5)Fold the length-side edges neatly over the top and towards the center (much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular present)<br />6)Place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag- making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag, which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bag.<br />7)Seal the bag, then vacuum-seal the bag by using the hand pump (can be purchased with the vacuum bags)<br />8)Do this with the remaining coffee beans (leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few days)<br />9)Check each plastic bag, by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packed.<br />10) Place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box, or a canvas bag (or some sort of storage to keep light out)<br />11) Store in a room temperature closet (about 60-75 degrees F)- making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could break.<br />12) Check the vacuum seal periodically and re-pump if necessary<br />13) This coffee will stay fresh for months this way!<br /><br />May seem like a bit of work, and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags- but, it's worth it!\n",

That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super-fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness. No refined sugar, artificial ingredients, or caffeine either. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, grape juice concentrate, grape fruit juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum acacia (from acacia trees), ester gum, red cabbage extract (color). One serving (which is 8 fl.oz.) contains 10 mg sodium and 25 g total carbs.\n",

      "I used another one of the Clorox brands of cat litter, one that was more expensive, for my last cat who passed away. Now that I have two kittens, I thought I would try to save money. I found the Odor Shield formula at the local Big Box Store - only it did not say if it was scented or unscented, as it shows on the pictures here. I even wrote to the company, asking to verify before i purchased it, but they merely sent back a form letter. So I thought, it was by the same company that made the other litter, how bad could it be? For clumping ability, odor control, and my cats using it - it was very good. However, it was indeed scented, and there was now dust everywhere - not just near the litter boxes in my laundry room, but over most of the house. Also, the kittens reeked of the scent for quite a time after they had finished using the box. When one of my kittens started itching, I switched back to the other, more expensive brand of litter. Although I am still not sure if the extra scent and dust from the Fresh Step was the cause of the itching, I won't bother trying any box of Fresh Step- even if it says its unscented and low dust. Because the other litter has proved my point, and I can now fold clothes in the laundry room without worrying that I am putting clean clothes on top of a washer/dryer covered in litter dust. Sorry, Fresh Step, I was hoping on saving some money here. Anyway, although I did not purchase the cat litter from Amazon, I just wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.\n",

Second Ingredient is corn, I found whole corn kernels in the bag.<br /><br />It does have rye etc. but the rice is overpowering, and considering that you can get 20lbs of rice for $7-8 at an asian market, this product seems overpriced.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be comparable to the traditional muslix type breakfast cereals (oats, rye, barley, wheat) but it is corn,rice, barley, millet etc and tastes pretty bad -- If you want the experience of this cereal, overcook some rice, and throw some oatmeal + bird seed into it...<br /><br />I tried to eat this for 4 days,  decided well if its not that healthy, and taste bad, why am I even bothering.  the birds in the back yard can enjoy it, because i didn't.\n",

      "Have been using Natural Calm for 6 years. Highly absorbable form of magnesium helps with nutritional balance and is a quick-acting, gentle muscle relaxer/tension tamer. If you take calcium supplements or eat a lot of dairy, you might consider supplementing with magnesium. Calcium is used in contracting muscles; magnesium is used in relaxing them. If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax! My old massage therapist gave this to every client before his/her massage; she said she didn't have to work as hard to relax stubborn, tense muscles after folks had taken this. Hubby takes it on business trips to keep all systems balanced and avoid tension headaches from Atlanta airport! This is hands-down the best price I've seen for the product, and it was delivered to my door. Can't beat that.\n",

      "After all the problems with dry food from other countries and scared that I was making my dogs sick, I started them all on solo's grain-free with raw meat diet.  They love it. They have normal, firm stool and less of it to Poop Scoop.  It seems expensive at first, but the results  are worth it, really.  I mix a large batch of solo's with water as instructed, and put it in the refrigerator, then I mix with assorted raw beef or cooked chicken and turkey.  BE CAREFUL..every dog is different and you have to gauge each dog differently, just like humans.  I have 2 Chihuahuas and a Pom, one chi blew up like a balloon and the other hasn't gained or lost weight.  If you have more than one dog I would have a bowl for each and feed separately and observe! because I found my little fatty was eating what the others left behind in their bowls.  The amazing thing is they no longer beg for treats like they used to.  I always felt like they were starving all the time.  And the big ++++ is that they have actually calmed down quite a bit, not nearly as hyperactive as they were before.  My husband and I sit down for dinner and we never hear or see them.  I'm not a paid spokesperson and I was highly skeptical about this type of diet for my fur kids.  But after seeing previous pets have health problems for no apparent reason, I have to think the dry food is not healthy for them.  Also...very important...I do give them the dry biscuits to help with tarter control on their teeth.  That is the only daily treat I give them now.  I do not feed them anything that is imported from china, nothing against them, it's just not what I feel is best.  The results are in front of me and I see a huge difference.  Just don't get frustrated at first with the preparation of the food.  My chi's and pom each weigh 5 pounds full grown.  I give them a 1/4 cup raw hamburger and 1/4 c hydrated solo's twice a day.  They are very active so that's what has worked for us. Hope this helps you make the change.\n",

      "I love this beaba machine. I used it every single day when we were making purees (my son is now into the chunkier meals) and I still use the steamer option to this day to make steamed apples and pears. Yes, you can probably get the same effect with a traditional steamer basket, pot, hot water and blender. But that's the beauty of this little machine. It's all 3 things in one which means less clean up too.<br /><br />pros:<br />* EASY TO USE - the beaba babycook is super easy to use. The first couple tries I found myself having to think about each step (measure water level, pour water, align basket, align lid, turn knob to steam) but after a few times, you completely get the hang of it.<br /><br />* LIQUID RESERVES - so one of the best things I found about the beaba is that you can save the liquid from the steaming process and use it to mix in with other foods. For example, whenever I steam apples or pears, I save the liquid that's collected on the bottom and mix it in with oatmeal for an apple/pear oatmeal bowl. This is something that I found I can't do with a traditonal steamer/pot and blender. Any root vegetables, I would discard the liquid (mainly because of my fear of pesticides and such) but everything else, I would keep the liquid and mix it in with foods.<br /><br />* EASY TO CLEAN - the only things you have to clean are the steam basket, blender pot, and lids. They're dishwasher safe too so it can't get any easier than that.<br /><br />cons:<br />* SMALL BASKET - you can only cook a small amount of food at any time. I found that I could only fit around half a potato (diced) at a time. This wasn't a big issue for me because it only takes around 5-6 minutes for the steam to be done. But there were times that I used the traditional steamer basket/pot to steam 2-3 whole potatoes at once (for the freezer) and used the beaba blender to puree.<br /><br />* STAINS - the plastic material is a bit porous so you will see stains (especially from carrots and beets). The plastic steam basket will DEFINITELY stain. Mine is an orangey-color, from the carrots and sweet potatos.<br /><br />* EXPENSIVE - it is quite costly and it's really hard to find these on sale. If you plan on using it for one kid, I would reconsider. If you plan on using it for more than one kid, might be worth the investment.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very glad I made the purchase. Not only is it functional, it looks super cute on your kitchen counter. And makes the baby food making process that much more \"fun\".\n",

Like many of the other reviewers before me, I haven't had marshmallows in a long time because of my commitment to vegetarianism.

These seem less prone to becoming stale--I stored mine for a month after opening them, and they always tasted fine.

The smell is light and the shape of the shampoo container is opposite of the conditioner so people with bad eyes won't confuse them while in the shower without glasses. It is too soon to know if this will help hair grow by nourishing the roots but when used with the matching conditioner and a blow-dryer it seems to have a lasting lift.  I've used it twice. Will report back if there is long term hair growth (although that might be more than a shampoo can do.)\n",

      "I have fed my last two dogs Premium Edge Senior dog food with lamb being the protein.  I am currently mixing it with Premium Edge large breed puppy chow which is a 27/16 protein/fat.  Typically German Shepherd's are fed<br />large breed puppy chow through 15 months.  My GS has Panoesteitis (Long Bone Disease) and I needed to reduce the protein without any additional growth components while still feeding her the necessary requirements.  She eats Premium Edge Large Breed Puppy Chow Lamb based and I substitute one of her four cups a day with the Senior Light.  I discontinued her vitamins due to the excess protein and I feed her as mentioned above.  I think the added supplements for seniors helped with her limp and strengthened her bones overall.  She is 13m months old and almost done with the Panoestetis; it is a self-limiting disease and generally heals by 18mo - 2 yrs.  I am not advocating that protein causes Panoesteitis - its just one of the mentioned possible causes.<br />I would recommend Premium Edge which is made by Diamond foods.  Google Diamond Foods and you will see all the brands they supply.\n",

      "Others may have a different experience. We were using this as a supplement to mother's milk because mother's milk just did not seem to provide enough fat / protein for baby to gain weight. Problem, although stated that Goat's milk is easier to digest, we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mother's milk, she ate more infrequently and got constipated with indegestion. We had bought this to help with digestion, as Formula is based on cow's milk. This goat's milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby, and she didn't gain weight. Also, the taste isn't so great.<br /><br />We can use it as back up, in case we don't have milk in the fridge. So, it's OK, but I probably won't buy again.\n",

      "I bought this 24-Count box of Extreme Berries over six months ago to liven up bottled water for my long stays on campus. I didn't really consider the purported health benefits and I think I snagged them when they were discounted. The first time I mixed some up I noted the taste was unusual in some way but also picked up on its \"natural\" flavoring. I'm not implying it's not naturally flavored, but that the flavor tasted natural, which is a good thing. Even at a discount they weren't exactly cheap either so I really wanted to like them. But 6 months later I have more than half left and I rarely finish them once I've mixed them up. I typically get through about 3/4ths of it and then I can't really stand the taste anymore. Now part of the problem is they may have aged and the ingredients may have deteriorated without the demonized preservatives I presume they excluded. But now it tastes, if it didn't always, like strawberry chalk. If it was the only sweet thing I ever allowed myself to have, it probably would taste pretty good. But now it kind of tastes like a bunch of ground up sweet tarts suspended in water without the sugar. Now that I've picked out this chalkiness it seems very distinct and I just can't enjoy it anymore. Now considering all the good stuff its supposed to have in it, and the ingredient list does seem to impress, it's important to be fair. This is a health food (dietary supplement as it says on the box) and that wasn't really what I was looking for. It's not the worst tasting of that kind of product I've ever had and all I can really say is that in that regard it meets expectations.<br /><br />Note that it is sweetened with stevia if that interests you. Really this is all about the antioxidant blend. I don't know what competition is out there but I can say the other means of imbibing the antioxidants in this seem to me like a far less palatable endeavor.\n",

The flavor has much to be desired--very oily with an over-powering lemon aftertaste.  The flavor immediately made me think \"so this is what lemon pine sol tastes like.\"  There have to be a better options.  Don't give up on Amys if this is your first experience--close your eyes and pick one of the other Amys flavors because it will taste better than this.  If it were thicker, with more vegetables and a bit more coconut over lemon, maybe it would be worthy of three stars. Maybe.\n",

      "WHILST I'LL NEVER STOP CONSIDERING POTATO CHIPS, (especially barbeque potato chips, sigh!), as my favourite snack, PIRATE'S BOOTY popcorn snacks come a very, (very!) close second.  Since they are made of popcorn, (and not potatos), they are better for one's over-all health -- especially one's eyes.  Potatos are,  (ssady : (  a STARCH, and no matter how much nutrition they contain, they still are loaded with carbohydrates, and starches..... :_(<br /><br />Aha - and Avast, there!  As here come the (very!) friendly \"Pirates\", who make \"Pirate's Booty\" snacks.  This particular flavour, AGED WHITE CHEDDAR, is totally scrumptious, besides giving the crunchiness that potato chip lovers crave! : )(People who list potato chips as their favourite snacks -- such as Diane Sawyer, (and me!) -- are reputed to show a personality that wants to TAKE CHARGE!  Yep -- potato chip lovers are the natural leaders of the world, those who crave power!<br />I know that both I -- and I'm sure Ms. Sawyer -- want power so that we can do GOOD things for the rest of humanity, abd why not?  (Don't kid yourself -- there ARE, and HAVE BEEN such people, throughout history.  THEODORA, once a slave and then wife of Emporer Justinian was one.  With her power, she wanted to HELP the poor of Byzantium.<br />Really!  Of course, the born aristocrats didn't like THAT too<br />much!  Or, THE GREAT of Russia, who worked alongside of workers to help build his palace!  And J.F.K. Jr, (and Sr?) who belonged to the 'ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY', as well as OPRAH WINFREY, (I'm not sure that potato chips were/ are the favourite snack of JFK Jr., (or Senior), or of Ms. Winfrey -- but I'd take a bet on it),..as well<br />as....well.....DIANE SAWYER, whom I saw on TV saying that potato chips WERE her favourite snack, and....and...well, and hopefully, me, if I ever can find a way to get the wealth and power which my love of potato chips so clearly indicates!)<br /><br />Yet potato chip must, of course, be eaten with discretion, and not with abandon....or one's hope for a healthy life will also soon be....abandned.  PIRATE'S BOOTY, who's major ingredient is not potato chips, but much more healthy popcorn, (here topped with scrumptious aged white cheddar cheese -- also a carbohyrate and starch...but which here, as a topping, is, though one can definitely taste it('s yumminess), is not nearly as much of an ingredient as<br />potato chips have potatos!  For those who have heretofore only had<br />the caramel, Cracker-Jack type coated popcorn, the infinitely lighter, (though still totally scrumptious!) taste of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks will come as a revelation.  One can find oneself eating just as much of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks, (especially THIS delightful aged cheddar flavour...at least for me!), as one heretofore did with potato chips!  Only -- much of the guilt is gone, because, ounce for ounce, these PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks are far, far healthier!<br /><br />And -- PLEASE don't think of \"nasty\" pirates, such as Peter Pan's Captain Hook, or the real-life Salesian Pirates, when you eat this wonderful snack.  Think of....Caotain Ballows, in the movie, \"The Crimson Pirate\", or Dr. Peter Blood, (played by Errol Flynn!), in the movie, \"Captain Blood\".  These are good, and HEROIC pirate figures...pirates who fought for freedom! (And who knows, but that SOME present, real-life \"pirates\", may someday soon do the same thing?)<br /><br />Althogh these snacks are NOT vegan, they ARE certified kosher.<br /><br />At any rate -- be sure to FREE yourself of needless calories,<br />and carbohydrates!  Have delicious PIRATE'S BOOTY Snacks, at least half the times you reach for potato chips!  As the Pirate's parrot might say: \"Awwwwk!  They're Goooooood!\"\n",

      "I love a good strong cup of coffee - my favorite K-Cup is the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Extra Bold, but I'll try any of the extra bold varieties and enjoy most of them.  So the \"Fuhgeddabboudit\" flavor intrigued me and I pre-ordered a box of 36 cups.  Took about a month to arrive, and I just tried it this morning.<br /><br />First off, the people talking about these things making messes on the counter aren't kidding.  The very first cup leaked all over the place, and gave me a cup full of grounds.  I was almost reluctant to try another one - something like that can't be very good for your Keurig machine - but gave it a shot.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, but it didn't measure up to the Double Black Diamond, and since it's essentially the same price, why shouldn't I get the stuff I really like instead?  I found the flavor a little thin, lacking the richness of a DBD cup.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The real trouble is, I'm reluctant to play K-Cup Roulette with these, given that lots of people are apparently having this same issue.  I believe I'm going to contact Amazon about returning these - I'm not willing to risk screwing up my $150 Keurig with poorly-made defective K-Cups.<br /><br />The people at Brooklyn Bean Roastery need to pay a little more attention to quality control.  There's really no excuse for this sort of rampant shoddiness in their products.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon refunded my money without even wanting me to return the K-Cups.  Once again Amazon's superb customer service takes care of a problem and makes a customer happy.  If only all businesses were so easy to deal with and focused on doing whatever it takes to satisfy their customers.\n",

Couldn't wait to brew up a cup of Red Goji and Raspberry.  Noticed there wasn't a lot of fragrance when I opened the bag, but thought well maybe it'll release when brewed.  Blech!  What a disappointment!  The predominant flavor is strongly the bitterness of green tea.  Since then I have tried all three of these new \"Superfruit\" flavors and I am extremely disappointed in every one of them. The Purple Acai and Blueberry one has the most fragrant smelling teabag, but the results are just as disappointing. Despite all the hype and the pretty packaging, there is very little flavor to any of these except for the green tea flavor.  Looking for someone to give this stuff to, because I really won't drink it.  By the way, I drink a lot of tea and a lot of different kinds of black, green and herbal teas, and I do know Earl Grey from Irish Breakfast and rooibos from chamomile and yerba mate'.\n",

Well, its been at our Cosco for over 3 months now-I hope it's not seasonal anymore. We love this sauce. It is good on Ravioli and Tortalini but also good on Quinoa pasta with Feta and over veggies w/o pasta. Our family eats this almost every week. You won't be disapointed. BTW-we are gluten and dairy free and the butter in this sauce seems to be just fine for our family. Great stuff!\n",

If you are going to Salzburg, get it only to experience this interesting piece of culture.

      "When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the \"nuggets in gravy\" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being.\n",

      "I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.<br />~T.S. Eliot<br /><br />He was my cream, and I was his coffee -<br />And when you poured us together, it was something.<br />~Josephine Baker<br /><br />I'm more of a tea girl than a coffee girl, but I definitely like some java on occasion and tend to associate it with good things: warmth on a hot day, sitting around the table with friends and loved ones, that extra jolt that helps the world make sense. And I really tend to like flavored coffees. I tried this product twice and it really left me feeling right down the middle. I didn't love it or hate it, but it was okay. The first pot was made after Sunday dinner and drank black and the second one was made yesterday morning where I drank it on the front porch while I read and bird watched while the rain fell gently and I had it with cream and sugar. These are two nearly ideal set-ups to evoke good coffee feelings, and I just wasn't impressed. There was mild gratitude for the caffeine during the morning session.<br /><br />Yes, it tasted like hazel nut, and I guess Creme Brulee, and I like both of these flavors and the coffee was smooth, but the end result wasn't as pleasing as it should be, as I anticipated it being, as the random cup of coffee at one of the local restaurants is on any given Sunday.<br /><br />Later on in the day, my husband asked me about it since he was the won I conned into brewing the second pot. I told him pretty much what I said here and that I'd probably assign 3 stars. I asked him what he thought, \"It's all right, I guess. Nothing I would rush out to buy. 3 stars sounds about right.\"<br /><br />I'll drink it, but like the man said, I won't rush out to buy it.\n",

      "The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the \"chicken pot pie\" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.\n",

      "Although I found this product to be not as fizzy or filling as a soda, my children (ages 9 and 12) absolutely loved Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice in Blackberry.  My son thought it tasted like a less sweet version of Clearly Canadian and my daughter thought it tasted like \"fizzy grape juice\" and was \"totally awesome.\"<br /><br />I allowed my children to take a can to school to drink with their lunches, instead of juice boxes, and they were thrilled.  They even took some for their friends, who proclaimed Izze the best non-soda fizzy drink around.  Granted, I would not allow them to take this drink everyday, but as a particular treat, it's healthier than most juice boxes, kool aid, soda, and a whole lot more fun to drink than warm cafeteria milk.<br /><br />At 8.4 ounces, there's just enough in a can to quench any thirst.  The slender can makes it easy to slip into a bag.\n",

It makes a strong, hot cup every time, which is a huge improvement over our standard pot of coffee maker. I was a little worried about the cost of each cup, but if you shop around and check the price per cup you can save a lot of money. Costco seems to be the best deal, but you need to buy 80 cups at a time. This is not an issue for us because we drink a lot of coffee. We bought a sampler box at Sears and that gave us an idea of what we like. I also bought 2 EkoBrew reusable k-cups (the reviews on the Keurig reusable cups were not good) so that we have the option of using up our bulk coffee. The water is easy to refill, no spills. I empty the leftover coffee from each k-cup into a container and then use that as fertilizer in my plants. We also just discovered k-cups at Costco from the SF Bay company which don't have the plastic bottom, just  the filter which reduces the plastic going into landfill. Plus they were only $25.99 for 80 cups (.37 per cup!). Great company, tasty coffee. Highly recommend this coffee maker!\n",

      "In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the \"K-Cup\" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig \"Brew\" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!\n",

      "If you see Vernors Ginger Ale in the store at it's usual price, ie. > $3.00 snap it up as it is much better than Canada Dry or comparably priced Ginger Ale/Beer. I don't understand the point of vendors selling a product here and then charging between 50%-125% of the product price in delivery costs. Who is ever going to purchase anything with S/H fees that high?<br /><br />I have recently become a fan of good Ginger Ale/Beer and would love to find a consistent reliable source for Vernors(for every day drinking) to some of the really good brands; Cock N Bull, Reeds, or the last brand I tried, which I believe was named Santa Cruz,for when you want something really good.<br /><br />I have tried making it at home and it works well aside from the thus far insoluble issue of fermentation after 5-7 days (even refrigerated). If you can find this with free shipping, fill your storeroom, but aside from that, I don't know. The few brands Amazon carries with free shipping, I have issues with. Fever Tree; not great and 7 oz.bottles; Hansen's; too much vanilla taste, really overpowering. If you truly like ginger in different incarnations, the Ginger People make an excellent 5 oz. bottle of ginger juice; a drop of which will invigorate mass produced ginger ale. Their shipping is also outrageous but here is a tip with which I reluctantly part. Vitacost.com carries it by the case 12 bottles @ $4/btl. and has very cheap S/H-free over $75 and they have a broad line of nutritional supplements that you can easily add to cart to get total above $75 and get free shipping.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a quality ginger ale/beer distributor that offers free shipping, I'd love to know. In the meantime, even Canada Dry has responded and is now actually putting ginger in their ginger ale. I couldn't believe that it was all artificially flavored until about 9 months ago.\n",

The rice crispies were a little \"different\" than I expected.I don't quite understand why you make us buy quantity when your packaging is not pre packaged? I expected to get four boxes somehow stuck together or banded together to ease your shipping costs and was quite surprised to get cereal one or two boxes of cereal to a shipping box.If that is how you are going to ship it wouldn't it be better to let us buy smaller quantities to increase your overall sales?\n",

The blueberries aren't full sized, or even like raisins, but rather like those preserved fruits you get in some types of cereals. It's still good, but I wouldn't recommend the pack if you're only buying it for the blueberry flavor. Another nice feature is that these grains are a bit softer than traditional granola, so it's not as crunchy to chew. Overall, not a bad choice to spice up your yogurt.\n",

I would take a swig of a just-opened box of coconut water, only to taste a sour, rancid, carbonated liquid. Let's do the math: I was forced to throw away 50% of what I paid for, meaning I wasted about $13.50.

You people are just too embarrassed to admit it.  :)  Well, as a former college student, I have learned to love Taco Bell, mostly for their cheapy \"Mexican\" food.  But it turns out they can make some nummy sauces, too!  We had this on burritos (homemade!) the other night, and it really tastes good!  And looking at the nutrition info explains it all.  Two tablespoons has 11 grams of fat and 300 milligrams of sodium.  And somehow 4% of the daily value for vitamin A snuck in there.<br /><br />This has a little bit of a bite, but it's not spicy.  There is a good smoked chipotle flavor to it.  I really like it and would buy more.  But in the interest of my blood pressure, maybe not all the time.\n",

      "Our cat is pretty picky.  He eats a raw handmade dinner at night and a high quality dry food with water in the morning.  He is an outdoor cat.  When I get something new to give him, he often will look at me partially interested and then take a sniff or a lick and want to go outside.<br /><br />When our cat is hot, he often is not very interested in food.  He flops down and complains all day when it is hot, but does not like much of anything- food included.  The day I got my package of these treats in the mail, our cat was flopping underneath some planters on the porch.  He was not overly interested in me when I came out the door, other than to give me a tiny \"Mew\" to let me know he was there.<br /><br />I walked over to him with the box of sealed treats and told him I had a treat for him.  He began to sniff the air.  He almost never does that- especially with a sealed bag in a box!  I opened the box and then struggled with the bag as the peel off top which leads to a zip lock back inside did not come complete off.  The cat jumped on my leg and began to help me open the bag.  Clearly he was interested.<br /><br />Then I finally managed to get the bag open, and I broke one of the thick cakes of treat in half and held it up to him.  He leaped in the air and grabbed it with his paws like hands, and forced it on the ground where he held it in place with both hands and claws.  He held it and chewed on it with passion until it was all gone.  He even licked little crumbs up off the floor, something he almost never does.<br /><br />I decided to give him the other half and told him that it was all he would get.  He jumped in the air and begged until he got the cake from me.  He did things he rarely does when I offer him anything to eat.  Then he polished off that too.  When he was done, he went back to being the ultimate cool cat and adopting his sense of boredom at my existence he went back to flopping under the planter.<br /><br />These treats smell delicious, stay fresh in the bag, and I have to say that these treats bring about such a passion and excitement in our cat that he gets all happy and really into the process of eating a treat, licking it all up until it is gone.  I rarely see him get this excited over any food item except his homemade dinner at night.  I can not recommend these highly enough.  I am thinking these will be a regular feature at our house from this point on!\n",

      "This tea is very mild and really does taste great and I could definitely see myself drinking this everyday. I mainly use loose leaf teas, but find tea bags useful for the office or if I'm in need of a quick fix. This tea is a great value, the bags are individually wrapped, they smell great and I've tried two and three steeping with one bag and while you loose the caffeine after the first steep, the taste was really good.<br />Just a quick note, do not add boiling water to this tea, the water should be under 200 degrees (not sure on the exact temps). What I do is get the water just to boil, let the water sit 3 minutes and then pour. I will steep the tea for about two to three minutes. For a second infusion I only let the water sit for about 30 seconds to a minute. Works for me.<br />I can recommend this tea highly, I think you will like it.\n",

Not the best root beer I have ever had, but certainly as good as some of the popular brands at the grocery store.

Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said \"Dark Chocolate\" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as \"Dark Hot\" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says \"Dark Chocolate\" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.\n",

      "I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is \"supposedly\" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.\n",

Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.

We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.\n",

      "As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass.\n",

This is a very good product.  I will continue to buy them for my dogs.\n",

She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else.

      "I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.\n",

      "Ok, so I want to start this by saying that we have been eating Cocoa Loco bars on an almost daily basis for about 2 years.  My son can not eat wheat or dairy, and he absolutely loves these little bars.  They have made a wonderful, irreplaceable breakfast bar, or snack for the car.  We also order cases of Enjoy Life granola and chocolate chips on a regular basis.  So this review is coming from someone who REALLY likes their products.  Fast forward to 3 1/2 weeks ago: we go onto Amazon and see that the bars have been changed to a \"new recipe.\"  This really worried my son, but we ordered a case and anxiously awaited their arrival.  The bars came and EVERY single one was covered in GREEN, FUZZY mold.  Yes, we opened each and every bar in the whole case!!  So, instead of calling Amazon, I called the company direct, feeling like they should know about this asap.  I talked to a representative from the company and she said that they already knew about the mold, but it had been too late and a few cases were sent to customers.  She said that they would send a replacement case asap.  I was so happy and figured that we could expect the new bars in a few days. 3 wks passed and I realized we hadn't received the new case.  Sent a long email to the company telling them how disappointed I was and after a few days I got a one line email saying the case would ship today.  No explanation, no apology, nothing.  So, I won't hold my breath about the replacement, and I sincerely hope this company works on their public relations skills.  (I wouldn't have even written this email if someone just admitted that they had \"dropped the ball\" and apologized)  The allergy community definitely needs good brands and hopefully this one will improve.\n",

      "These are the best sun dried tomatoes that I have found for several reasons.  These reasons include:<br /><br />1) Not packed in oil:  The first reason I love this product is that the tomatoes are not sun-dried and then packed in oil.  Many sun dried tomatoes come in large jars and have some type of liquid substance preserving them/adding flavor.  These do not.  They are dried and packed tightly into these little plastic containers.  The absence of oil makes these healthier and cleaner to work with.  Even though these lack a liquid component, there is still a softness to them.  They are not rock hard like some of the bags of sun-dried tomatoes out there.<br /><br />2) Little waste: The second reason I love this product is the size of the containers.  At 3.5 ounces, you have a manageable amount to use.  You don't need to worry about waste.  When you have a massive jar, once opened, the tomatoes are only going to stay usable for so long.  It is easy to use a 3.5 ounce container with one or two recipes.<br /><br />3) The taste:  I love the taste of these tomatoes.  A nice salty flavor accompanies them, but the salt doesn't overtake the phenomenal tomato taste.<br /><br />4) Perfect with pastas:  I love to make pastas, especially pierogies.  Perogies happen to taste wonderful with wilted spinach and sun-dried tomatoes that have been sauteed in brown butter with salt, pepper and some broth.  You don't need to stop with pastas though.  Try these tomatoes on salads and with sandwiches.  Each container has a recipe printed on the back of the lid.<br /><br />5) Perfect alone: The user doesn't have to feel a need to be creative with these tomatoes because they are perfect on their own.  Counting calories?  Mix up your daily eating routine and include a pack of these sun-dried tomatoes.  They have 225 calories per container, have a good deal of fiber (16.8 grams per container) and potassium and vitamin C.  Disclosure:  These have a good deal of sodium (300 mg per serving and there are 7 servings per container).<br /><br />6) Portable: Take these on a car trip.  Because the containers are made out of plastic, they won't break.  You don't have to worry about your children breaking a glass container and injuring themselves.  Again, because these are not packed with oil, you don't have to worry about liquid substances being splashed all over your car either.<br /><br />7) Packaging recyclable:  These tomatoes are packed in #1 PET plastic, which is readily recyclable in most areas.<br /><br />8) They last:  Because these have a lot of salt and are well-packed, they remain fresh for a very, very long time.  I've purchased large sums of these tomatoes and have had them sit for months unused.  When I experience a sun-dried tomato craving, I don't worry about the freshness because they have such a long shelf life.<br /><br />In sum, I love these tomatoes.  I use probably two packs a week for recipes and casual snacking.  I love that they are packed without any type of liquid and the containers are sized just right for recipes and/or casual snacking.<br /><br />I purchase these 3.5 ounce containers for about two dollars from my local grocery.<br /><br />These tomatoes are a product of Turkey and should be refrigerated after opening.\n",

I was never before a fan of chocolate covered cherries as they are too sweet and gooey, but Mon Cheri is totally different. They have a subtle, full flavor with a slight hint of alcohol and are not runny, sticky or gooey. Now I give them as gifts every year, including one box to myself. (I believe they are only offered at Christmas time as they do not have a long shelf life and thus go bad quickly.) Meyers German Deli in Chicago used to carry them, but when they closed I turned to ordering them online, which does cost a little more but is worth it. Highly recommended.\n",

      "My husband has raved about Slap Stix from his childhood (he's in his 40's.) He thought they had stopped making them because he hasn't been able to find them anywhere in over 10 years. For an early holiday gift and to try them myself, I decided to look online to see if they were still made, found & bought some. After tasting these, I see why he loved them. The flavor is really unmatched by any of the candies out there today. Although it says \"lollipop\" in some of the descriptions, its really more of a taffy and caramel blend on a stick that you can lick but will end up chewing.<br />  Its based in caramel with flavored taffy's swirled in-the yellow is banana, and is the flavor most tasted along with the caramel. The white gives hints of vanilla, while the pink I think just adds to the sweetness. These are not too sweet or overwhelming though, and while the combination sounds a little off, when it comes together in this candy, it tastes wonderful. It does have different textures while chewing-Soft caramel, taffy in the pink and yellow, and a fluffy nugget like consistency to the white swirl.<br />  Buying from another online site before, I'd recommend buying from Amazon instead simply because of some packages being Prime eligible and variety of options (Count of bulk, buying alone, or in gift baskets with other candies of the same era.) If you plan on buying candy gift baskets by era's, I would suggest getting a package of these as well and adding more to the basket or even adding them to gifts with the bows and ribbon. However, these aren't something I'd recommend for a person with dentures. These are hard to find locally, so online is the way to go. I'm definitely buying again, only this time I'll save on shipping and go with Amazon. Hope this helps those who haven't had them before but have a friend raving about them:)\n",

The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.

      "These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are \"popped\" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.\n",

I had to use 5 tea rounds to make the tea to the strength that I wanted when I would make a pitcher of it.  Purchasing this Davidson's in bulk is the way to go. I was amazed at the size of the bag and the quality of the tea. It is simply yummy!!! I have read quite a lot about the health benefits of drinking this tea. I am pleased with the great side effects but quite honestly I would drink it even if there were not health benefits. The best way to sum up the taste is sweet/sour when mixed with stevia.

I bought this cereal knowing it is healthy because I am trying to lose a few (read that as 10) pounds and be healthy about it so my husband and I can try to get pregnant (I'm over 35, so higher risk).  It has great nutritional value and I decided to try it instead of my \"usual\" Grape Nuts.  (Figured it would save my teeth.) :-)<br />It is not, not, not tasty.  It is very bland (which is OK, I guess) and mildly sweetened, but it tasts like I've decided to eat one of my dog's biscuits with a little honey.  It's fully edible, but it is not something I have to worry about anyone else eating because it isn't good.  It really doesn't taste good.  I read these other reviews that say it tastes great and wonder, \"what do these people usually eat?!\"  I would MUCH rather have my Grape Nuts or Shredded Wheat or some other granola/bran cereal.

      "I was first introduced the the Old El Paso Gordita Dinner Kits when I went over to a friend's for dinner back around 2000.  They made chicken they had cubed up added the seasoning etc.  They were fantastic! Since then have been regularly eating these and haven't regretted it one bit!<br /><br />To me the best part of the kit is that it comes with a creamy zesty ranch sauce packet which is tangy and pretty spicy but not too hot.  I even save the packet of the leftover sauce and use it for the next several days on things like nachos.  Yum!<br /><br />The next best part is the gordita shells themselves.  Nice and thick yet soft.  Make sure you warm them up in the microwave first to make them taste and feel better.  We usually throw them in the microwave between paper plates for about 80 seconds at between 30-50% power. Would like it if they were slightly bigger but for most people they are probably the perfect size.  The texture is great.  I always prefer soft shelled tacos and burritos over hard shell tacos, so if you prefer hard shell then this kit may not be for you or buy this in addition to hard shells and have some friends over ;)<br /><br />Sometimes we use ground beef; other times ground turkey; cubed chicken.  All taste great.  We probably have these once or twice a month (4 nights of food when you figure in leftovers) as buying 6 at a time is a commitment but we don't mind.  I think we used to get the 12 pack but then they weren't in stock for a while so we became sad until I recently did another search and came across the Pack of 6.<br /><br />*Another note if you want to save a step and some time:  The instructions say to brown the meat first then add water and the seasoning.  I skip the water and add the seasoning immediately to the meat in the beginning then brown the meat with the seasoning already on it.  I don't notice a difference.  Also recommend using a leaner ground beef to avoid a grease puddle at the bottom of your meat when you are done.\n",

Maybe, this is because the only sources for this honey are red and white clover blossoms. Also, being more thick than other honeys, it makes it hard to control intake: one tends to consume more, because it spreads as thick layer. Not a perfect dietary situation...\n",

      "Recently switched from feeding friskies for the past 15 years because one of my siamese was having kidney problems. Tried a lot of different higher end brand cat foods, Wellness, Evo, Nutro. He was picky about almost all of them except for the Weruva Mideast feast. He loves human tuna out of a can and comes running for it so I thought he might like it. Turns out even my other finicky siamese who has refused to eat anything but dry food his entire life will eat this! All four of my cats eat this like it's the best food ever. The only problem with that is I go through it so fast! The best thing though is that it has greatly improved my cat's kidney function and because of that is worth every penny to me. I will never go back to friskies and their corn and grain again. It was killing my cat.<br /><br />I'd also like to add that amazon has the best price on this food from everywhere else I've searched which is wonderful! Everywhere else charges 5 or 6 dollars more plus 10 dollars shipping. With amazon I get free 2 day shipping and a much better price. Thank you amazon.\n",

Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.\n",

      "Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G\">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI\">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups.  They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far.  But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast.  After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.\n",

Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don't per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor.\n",

The small dog was able to spend some time chewing these (I have to lock her in her crate away from the big dogs, though). These weren't individually wrapped, but they weren't smelly or yucky to handle.  They were stretched out as in the picture and stiff.  I didn't worry about choking.  They came in a big box with other items in the order (and so I wish they would have been prepackaged in a large bag to separate them from the other items).  These are a US product and have nothing added to them that I know of so I felt safe in giving them to the dogs.

      "I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.

I wasn't sure what the first picture they showed was, but all the others were pictures of the kind of cute little bunny I wanted for my girls.  Maybe the first one was a rabbit just after it was born or something.  Seeing that the price was fairly reasonable, I ordered one.  I wasn't quite sure how they were going to get a live rabbit to me through the mail, but I figured \"hey, if anyone can do it, Amazon.com can\".<br /><br />When the package got to my house, I started to get a slight feeling that something wasn't right.  The box they had sent had no air-holes, and it was strangely cold to the touch.  But I figured that I didn't know anything about rabbits, so maybe that was normal.  Deciding to press on, I wrapped up the box and placed it under the Easter-tree in our living room (actually, it's just our old Christmas tree that I was too lazy to take out to the end of the driveway, but I won't tell if you don't).<br /><br />On Easter morning, my girls were up early, wanting to open their Easter present.  I sat on the couch, with my arm around my wife as they tore the paper off the package.  Eagerly awaiting their cries of happiness, I was startled when instead I heard screams of fear and horror.  The youngest was screaming that someone killed the Easter bunny, and the oldest barely made it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  As I looked in the box, expecting to see that maybe the poor rabbit had accidentally died, I saw instead, a rabbit carcass, gutted and skinned.<br /><br />Thinking that someone had played a horrible joke on our family, I immediately called Amazon.com to explain what had happened.  When I finally got done explaining our situation, the lady on the phone told me that the rabbits were supposed to be dead, they were meat rabbits, for eating.<br /><br />This is perhaps something that should be explicitly written in the description of the product on Amazon's website.  My daughters were incredibly traumatized by the situation, and are now undergoing counseling (at a rate of $200/hour) to help them deal with what they saw.  I shudder to think of what Easter will be like next year.<br /><br />So in short, it needs to be said in the product description that these rabbits are DEAD, and they are for eating.  Don't make the same mistake I did.\n",

While some of the lines border on awful, the actors are (usually) believable... and who wouldn't mind watching a young Alec Baldwin (remember? back when he was a hottie?). This movie is a classic and a great addition to any movie library (if for nothing else than historical value).\n",

Most pubs were using BritVic tonic water in the little single-serving bottles, but I discovered on our return to the States that BritVic is completely unavailable in the US or Canada.

In order to fairly evaluate the product, I added it to my own turkey and cheese sandwich wrap. (It is not a low-cal condiment.) I'm sorry to say...I agree wholeheartedly with the boys.

      "Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting \"it\" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on \"coconut water laxative\" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you \"run\", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p\n",

      "This is the first Hormel Compleats product we've tried and I have to say, I was plesantly surprised. I'm not a foodie, but I do expect flavor from food, packaged or fresh.<br /><br />Others have commented about the contents matching the pix on the packaging. Pretty much it looked the same to me although the penne pasta and chicken are mixed well within the marinara sauce.<br /><br />Plusses:<br />>>Ease of use: slit some holes, pop in microwave for about 1 minute, 45 seconds. Take out, wait a minute or so, peel off top and eat. (Peeling it off took awhile. It seemed to have some sort of glue that stuck to the sides of the plastic container.)<br /><br />>>Flavor: The marina sauce was tasty and quite a bit better than some of the bottled marinara sauce I've had. Chicken tasted like chicken and penne pasta was firm (but not break your tooth firm) and not mushy, which is important to me.<br /><br />>>Nutritional Content: If the label is correct, this isn't too bad at all if you're looking for both good fiber and protein without exorbitant sugar or sodium. And with only 5% saturated fat, that's good for fresh or packaged.<br /><br />>>Great item to store at the office or a second home or anywhere else where food may not be readily available and/or you need some backup.<br /><br />This should not be viewed as a substitute for making your own pasta to order and using a homemade or other sauce, but it's not bad when you're starving and literally want to eat in three minutes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />>>Price, which varies depending on where you buy it. Amazon has good prices with subscribe and save but at the $3 and up that convenience stores that seem to stock it charge, not such a value.<br /><br />>>Availability. Not always easily found in our area. If you like this, amazon subscribe and save is probably the best way to get it fast, in quantity and at good price.<br /><br />I've looked online at the others in the compleats line. Not impressed due to very high sodium (why can't companies understand that most of us want low sodium. Really low. Folks who want more sodium will just add salt. Good spices and other flavorings can give us the taste we need.).<br /><br />I suspect that the appeal of this will depend entirely on your own tastebuds. If you're someone who regularly eats homemade pasta sauce with fresh pasta, this will be a tough substitute. But if you use bottled pasta sauce and packaged pasta, this is akin to a prepaid version of this. You can always rev it up by adding your own veggies (steamed or heated up frozen ones) with it.<br /><br />If this didn't require a microwave to heat it up, it would be a perfect item for an emergency food kit.\n",

      "We love rice around our house, and have tried a wide variety. We find white rice akin to library paste, and regular brown rice a bit like tree bark. This large bag of brown Basmati has become our favorite, both for flavor and for value. Brown rice has much better nutrition than white, by the way.<br /><br />For those who don't know it, Basmati rice has a delicious aroma even before you start to boil it. The flavor and texture are more interesting than white rice but not as sincerely virtuous as regular brown. The cooking is more like brown than white, however. Allow about 45 minutes, depending on the desired texture.<br /><br />While heating two to four cups water per cup of dry rice, I wash the rice with hot water. You'll see why. Drain and rinse, then add to boiling water and turn the heat to medium until it resumes boiling. After that, medium low will suffice. Frequent stirring is not needed if the heat is appropriate. After 30 minutes, I start to check more frequently.<br /><br />It's really best if you don't season brown rice until it's cooked. Read up on osmosis if it's not immediately clear to you why adding salt to the cooking water prolongs cooking time. Brown rice owes its reputation for being slow to cook almost entirely to recipes that add salt at the beginning (dried beans are the same way).<br /><br />To really tantalize the taste buds, add a tablespoon of Vegeta per cup of dry rice when the rice has reached the texture you like. Stir and let sit five minutes, covered. Mmmmmm!\n",

I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.\n",

      "Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.  I love them.  They come in four flavors.  Tropical is my least favorite of those flavors, but I still really like it, just not as much as the others.  The tropical flavor is more subtle than the other flavors; there isn't a strong flavor from any of the tropical fruits contained in it.  So if you enjoy the nuts and seeds and don't want a strong fruit component coming through, you might like the tropical ones best.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the \"glue\" that holds all the other ingredients together.  The \"third\" fruit in the tropical flavor is actually three tropical fruits:  pineapple, mango and papaya.  I can't taste any distinct flavor of pineapple and the mango and papaya are very light.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is \"good\" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.  I'd rather eat my least favorite flavor of these than just about any other bar.\n",

Some of the pods come out a bit weak, but not bad.  I've tried the Senseo, Cafe Halo, and Godiva pods, and all have been acceptable, but not outstanding.  The Wolfgang Puck pods appear to have more coffee in them, and provide a more robust flavor.  I've brewed several and have not had the tearing issues others have reported.

      "If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.\n",

It cooks wonderfully well and a little overlooking in terms of the recommended time does not turn the pasta to mush like other rice pasta.  Highly recommend.  Love it.\n",

      "If something sounds too good to be true, it is. These Miracle Noodles (should be called Nasty Noodles) are exactly that. Although the fishy smells washes off with proper rinsing and boiling the texture of the noodles is nauseating. I was literally gagging as I tried to swallow them. When you chew them they break a part like some odd watery substance. I tried the noodles twice, two different ways (once stir-fried and the other in a soup) and both times I was absolutely repulsed by their texture. I ended up throwing the remaining 3 packs in the garbage. Miracle Noodles may have no calories, but they also have no place in my mouth. They were disgusting and I caution you all! Plus, you can find them in your local grocery store for much cheaper (they are called shirataki noodles)\n",

      "My mom has made Christmas Stollen since my childhood in Bavaria. Then, a number of years ago, she happened upon the Kuchen Meister Edel-Marzipanstollen at Trader Joe's. That was the year she gave up making stollen because she came to the conclusion that it was almost as good as hers, but at about $3.50 per loaf, there was no way she was going to spend hours in the kitchen making the authentic stollen. If this review were simply about taste, I would have given it five stars and ended here.<br /><br />There are two problems with this stollen that caused me to knock off a star for each:<br /><br />1) Production consistency. My family consumes about a dozen of these each year for the Christmas Season. The difference in the amount of marzipan from one stollen to the next varies greatly. They average a decent amount, consitent with the picture on the box, but I often have some that are overloaded and some that have no marzipan at all. Better consistency would be nice.<br /><br />2) Ingredients. My family and I try (whenever possible) to be health conscious. I enjoyed this stollen more before I read the ingredients. With ingredients like hydrogenated vegetable fat, sorbitol, and artificial stollen flavor, I'm just not enjoying it as much as I used to. If I'm going to consume saturated fats, then I'd at least like to see them come from a natural source, like butter, not some artificially hydrogentated fat.<br /><br />The bottom line on this stollen is it tastes great, but it's pretty bad for you. I haven't made stollen since my mom passed away a few years ago, but next year I'll probably start again. Until then, this one is good too.\n",

      "I only wish I had taken pictures - the improvement is hard to believe!  About a month ago I was diagnosed with cellulitis on the heel of my foot.  The usual treatment antibiotics and ointment.  I completed the round of antibiotics and my foot actually seemed to be improving.  A week later it was worse and getting worse by the minute.  I really didn't want to do another round of antibiotics so I started looking for alternatives.  I read about honey.  Apparently, honey has amazing healing properties.  It's been used for centuries.  My reading introduced me to manuka honey from New Zealand.  I read a lot of articles on the internet and started looking for places to purchase.  When I found it available on Amazon I read the reviews.  I didn't read a bad one so I decided to purchase.  I am so glad I did.  I've been using the honey for 8 days and the improvement is amazing!  I have 2 small open sores left and almost all the dead skin has peeled away (sounds gross, I know).  I slather the honey on my heel twice a day and cover with guaze.  This stuff is amazing!  One of the reviews I read was from a woman with adult acne.  She uses the honey all the time to scrub her face.  My 30 yr old daughter has adult acne.  She's going to start using the honey too.\n",

I've been trying to get him to drink a shake in the hopes that it would improve his resistance to winter colds, but he wants no part of it (he's a very picky eater).  I of course am not relying on this to prevent me from getting sick, but I only wanted to try it and see if it was worth adding it to my arsenal of tools against winter illnesses.  I think it is, although I do think that this is not to take the place of taking care of yourself by eating whole, unprocessed foods, eating your regular fruits and vegetables, sleep and exercise.  I do think in additon to these practices, the Amazing Grass is a good product that could help your body get a little boost when compromised in the germy illness months.\n",

      "I was intrigued by these new \"flavor enhancers,\" so I took the opportunity to try one out.  I like peach tea, so I chose the Mio \"peach tea\" liquid.<br /><br />The bottle is pretty small.  The lid snaps securely in place.  It has a pinprick nozzle -- if you squeeze it with any force, it will shoot a thin jet of liquid with considerable force.<br /><br />I squirted a little into a glass of cold, filtered water.<br /><br />I can't say I was impressed.  While the product purports to use \"natural flavor with other natural flavor,\" whatever that means, this Kraft Foods liquid does not taste much like peach tea to me.  It tastes like a peach-flavored Jolly Rancher® circa 1982.  I got no tea flavor at all.<br /><br />I tried differing amounts of the Mio to see if I was simply using too much.  But that wasn't it.  Using less resulted in a watery drink without much flavor.  It just doesn't taste like peach tea.  It is reminiscent of peach candy with a somewhat odd aftertaste.  It's not quite the same as the artificial sweetener aftertaste of diet soda, but it's in the same ballpark.  Worse, the aftertaste lingered for several minutes.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.  Some people may like this.  To me, however, it tastes like a scientific counterfeit of peach.\n",

      "Before returning to work from maternity leave at 7 weeks, I'd already started exclusively pumping. Getting about 8oz per session. (Reading all the documentation about it, I was probably overproducing) The first week back at work was fine, no decrease. Second week, each day I was getting 1-2oz less a session. Third week, it dipped down even lower -losing 3-4oz/session. (So total, each session I was getting 2.5-3 oz- baby needs 4!) I started using FenuGreek, and maybe noticed an increase of about .5-1oz per session (taking 2 pills 3x a day). 4th week, I took 3 pills 3x a day...and this gave me an extra 1oz/session. I was producing just enough (barely) to keep up with baby and NOT enough to freeze any.<br /><br />I increased pumping sessions, to every 3 hours like clockwork- even throughout the night. This seemed to help. Luckily baby sleeps 6-7 hours now at night, so I could pump an extra bottle out during that time to make up for what I was lacking throughout the day.<br /><br />Side note: what helped me the MOST I feel - is stopping birth control. The dr. put me on BC at week 7, just as I stared back to work. When your supply is low, you'll try ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to get it back, so it's hard to say how much the FenuGreek helped. After 2 months of BC and FenuGreek I was keeping up, but just barely. On mo. 3, I stopped BC (still using FenuGreek) and with the added pumping sessions I now make enough for baby, and can freeze one 4oz bottle a day, and always have  3-4 bottles in the fridge at any given time - a must for daycare and the working mom! I'd rather use backup contraception than not breastfeed at all!\n",

I would like to think that it is because it is organic, but not all organic coffees taste this smooth.  So that leads me to believe that it is because it is water processed.  I will have to try another water processed coffee before I can truly say that is why.<br /><br />My husband on the other hand does not love this coffee.  He really likes D&D's, which I detest.  He also enjoys good ole Folgers.

It had a really nice taste with just enough hint of heat to be tasty but not overpowering. I do have a cooking suggestion, however--I followed the directions to the T (I always do the first time I make something like this) and I ended up having a hard time mixing the paste in quick enough because it really is a thick paste and it took more time that I thought for it to break down and my water was boiling away. Or something like that--I made it a few days ago and my memory isn't that great, but I just remember thinking that the next time, I'd pre-mix the water and paste outside of the pan first to make sure it's all reconstituted nicely with no lumps. I don't think there is any way you could get all the lumps out if you put the chicken in at the same time as the paste packet. ANYWAY, we had it with coconut rice and it was delish.

I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better.
