Also supposed seed pods specific order (as box) I didn't read took separate seed kit box didn't know order in. I think likely error list order inserted enclosed box avoid problem. I guessed order growing well.<br /><br />After set add water nutrients future machine tells flashing lights. Couldn't easier!! The instruction booklet short ( nice don't like reading instructions :) The confusing adding nutrients. The instruction book refers tablets/pellets receive plastic tubes liquid don't add tubes instruction says add tablets.
