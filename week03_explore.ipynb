      "We recently recieved 2 samples of the 5-Hour Energy and my Husband and my Son inlaw used them the next morning. They had both just gotten off from working night shift, my son in law a 8-10hr shift and my hubby a 12hr shift. They had to work on the car so both took the 5-Hour energy shots and were up all day. Not only did it give them the energy to stay awake and alert enough to fix the car, they also fixed the mower, built on a clubhouse for the kids and cut up a fallen treee in the yard. So in my oppinion the 5-Hour Energy is well worth the cost, and I would buy and use them again. \"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.\" \n",

      "I ordered this product from Amazon with hesitancy, which I normally buy from Indian grocery stores.  When I placed the order the shipping date showed as 30 to 45 days, but it arrived in 7 days.  The product was fresher and cheaper than any grocery stores.  I use it as a snack and to and to desserts. I was thrilled with the experience of ordering a food item from a website, from where I only bought electronic items and books.  This is one of the best purchases I made at Amazon. I ordered the \"Frontier Cardamom Pods\" along with this order to avoid paying shipping charges and plus I use it in Indian tea and desserts.  I give this product 5 stars as it arrived on time, and when I opened the packet it was fresh, and full of flavor and would highly recommend buying this product from Amazon. \n",

My cat stopped vomiting but it didn't help my wallet!  That particular dry food is extremely pricey (3.5 lbs for $24. Yikes!!)  So I had to look for alternative.  Nature Balance Green Pea & Duck is a great replacement and much cheaper (although not as cheap as I hope but I accept the fact that premium food cost more).  The only downside is that it is not available in the stores near my house. Although it is convenient to order online but still, I like to be able to pick it up in the local store. \n",

When we stop at a Starbucks' coffee shop, we know that we'll be paying a good deal more for the coffee -- but we're glad (?) to do so.  It's really fine coffee.  And so too with this 11-ounce package of ground coffee -- the price is more than a bit higher than the regular coffees.

      "As a foodie, I'm also a bit of a snob about teas, generally preferring organic, muslin-bagged or loose teas. That said, this Stash Chanakara Tea sampler, on first try, immediately became my favourite tea purchase, and I promptly ordered this excellent bulk value offered by Amazon, soon after trying each of the seven teas included in the box. Each tea \"chakra\" consists of extremely aromatic and flavour-filled combinations of herbs, flowers, leaves of a colour corresponding to each chakra. While I cannot offer evidence of their efficacy in chakra work, I will say I did some best-guessing about where my particular energies were on a given day, and found that the chakra-tea I chose each time really did seem particularly soothing. New age-y ideas aside, the teas really are extremely flavourful without being overly sour (as I find many brands, like Celestial Seasonings, can be). The scents are noticeably lovely, and for me, I didn't find one flavour that I didn't truly love. Highly recommend. \n",

I enjoy strong-flavored coffee, but bitter coffee is another story.<br /><br />Well, it turns out that I was just drinking the wrong stuff. Lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful. Strong, full-bodied, but no bitterness. Nice crema, smooth and rich. Really hits the spot!<br /><br />It does, however, have a bit more caffeine than other decafs. Not much, but I can feel it a bit (I'm very sensitive to caffeine - if you're not, you probably won't notice it). Not enough that it causes a problem. But even if it did, I'd probably still drink this - it's that good!<br /><br />Highly recommend. \n",

      "Having spent a decent amount on time in SE Asia (and Singapore specifically) during my childhood, I frequently get cravings for Singaporean-style curry, hawker food and snacks.  As a result I am constantly on a hunt for fresh and authentic ingredients when and where I can get them to attempt to reproduce those dishes at home.  I even have friends send spice mixes and tinned pastes  from Singapore when the markets here fail me.<br /><br />What makes this curry-in-a-packet so good is that it has 2 separate pouches for the spice mix and for the coconut mix. This ensures freshness and authentic flavour when the coconut is added to the mix at the correct moment during the cooking process.  Also, other Singaporean brands do not include the coconut  mixture (requiring additional purchases) or the coconut is already added (affecting flavour).  Prima Taste is one of many curry packets available in Singapore and has a loyal following for its authentic spices.  This is one of the brands that I am sent if my Singaporean friends don't use it all up first!<br /><br />Needless to say, I am really happy that Prima Taste is now available in N. America and through Amazon.<br /><br />To sum:<br />+ Authentic spices in a vacuum-packed pouch<br />+ Pouch of correct amount of coconut mixture (coconut milk plus fresh shredded coconut). So there is no need to buy a separate can of coconut milk and shredded coconut to be partially used.<br />+ All-in-one - just add meat<br />+ No need to hunt down separate ingredients.<br /><br />The only CON is that the prices are double that of Singapore but hopefully should come down as more people discover Prima Taste. \n",
